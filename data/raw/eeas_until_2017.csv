"EU Statement on the 2nd day of the 13th Trade Policy Review of the European Union, 07 July 2017",07.07.2017,07.07.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/29494_en,,"Mr Chairman, Mr Discussant, Distinguished Delegates, INTRODUCTION 1. I would like to use my intervention and the time available to engage systematically with all the comments and issues raised in the oral statements made on Wednesday. More questions have come in since then. We will reply to all outstanding questions within the deadline foreseen for this exercise. 2. I welcome the positive statements made on Wednesday and this morning, the vast majority of which emphasised the EU's openness and support for the multilateral trading system as well as our efforts to lead by example in the face of a growing backlash against globalisation and the risk of protectionism. I also welcome the multiple statements that have been made highlighting that the vast majority of trade with the EU is conducted in fact without any problems and that potential concerns are very much an exception rather than the rule. They are in fact limited to certain well defined areas.3. Many Members also recognise our efforts to push forward preparations for a successful MC11. Indeed, a successful Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires is a top priority for the EU and we have made every effort to make this objective a reality. 4. I'm happy to use this opportunity to confirm also the very positive news coming out of Brussels that the EU and Japan have indeed reached a political agreement on a free trade agreement which has every potential to redefine and significantly expand our trade relations. The deal shows that there is scope for ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreements that are fully compatible with the WTO.5. Several Members commended the EU for the value-based trade agenda set out in our Trade for All strategy and I am very happy with this positive reaction. Our efforts in this area highlight an important point: that trade is of mutual benefit and that we all stand to gain from trade which is fair and sustainable. This extends also to the issue of gender equality and women's empowerment, to which we attach great importance and on which we would like to see more activities in the WTO. The next opportunity in this regard will be next week's Aid for Trade Global Review.6. I will now answer the questions you raised on Wednesday and this morning as follows: I will start with a few more systemic issues, before moving to the specific questions, again under the 10 blocks. SYSTEMIC ISSUES 7. The implementation of the Agreements reached in Bali and in Nairobi is now a key concern and I'm happy to confirm that the EU is in the forefront of these efforts. Specifically on export competition, it is well known that the EU has not provided export subsidies since 2013. We are now finalising the preparation of a revised EU schedule that will bring our entitlements effectively to zero. This will be put forward to the Membership in the coming weeks. We call on other concerned Members to do the same in order to formalise the commitments made in Nairobi. 8. Over the last year, the EU has made clear its expectations for a substantive and meaningful outcome at MC11. We have supported this with concrete submissions on most of the areas under discussion. We commend all of you who have done the same. Now, true negotiations need to begin quickly. I would call on all Members to avoid tactical games and focus on substance, which is the only way we can work towards concrete outcomes in Buenos Aires. 9. For the EU, the outcome of MC11 as well as post-MC11 work is closely linked to our long-term objective of levelling the playing field by creating new rules in areas which are in dire need of new disciplines. This particularly includes the broad area of subsidies. In this regard, some Members referred in their statements to export credits and the very important work being done by the International Working Group (IWG), which brings together many participants including the EU, China, Brazil, India, South Africa and the US to pursue the shared goal of developing new export credit disciplines. What we are talking about here is clarifying the rules regarding prohibited export subsidies and ensuring that the major providers of export credits are in fact playing by the rules.10. One Member (China) referred to the EU's restrictions on exports of high-tech goods, particularly dual-use goods which can be used for both civilian and military applications. The EU implements its policies in this area within the clearly set limits of UN Security Council resolutions, WTO agreements and the cooperation that we have with numerous other Members in international export control regimes. Every export transaction is assessed on its own merits taking into account the risk that a particular item will be diverted to military end-use. I would underline that this well established policy does not in fact create any meaningful problems for legitimate transactions. What actually creates problems are efforts to divert civilian technologies toward military programmes and forced technology transfers.11.  The discussant and a few Members referred to some delays with regard to EU notifications. Allow me to reiterate that the EU treats transparency and notifications extremely seriously. Several EU notifications were actually made in recent weeks. These covered an STE corrigendum, our notification on Rules of Origin for LDCs as well as our GPA statistics. Regarding our domestic support notifications, it is well known that financing cycles vary across WTO Members and that they do not necessarily end on 31 December of each year. The last DS:1 notification by the EU covered the calendar year 2013-2014 and we are close to finalising the one for the 2014-2015 calendar year. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for every WTO Member, some of whom have not submitted the necessary notifications since the creation of this organisation in 1995. I would refer Members here to the useful compilation prepared by the Secretariat [document G/L/223/Rev.24]. 12. And finally, a few Members referred to the EU's tariff profile, mentioning explicitly our tariffs for agricultural and fish products. Some of you have higher agricultural tariffs while others have very high industrial ones. While tariff liberalisation efforts have been undertaken recently through bilateral and plurilateral tracks, such efforts have not been undertaken recently in the WTO. Future adjustments of Members' tariff structures need to take place within the context of comprehensive market access negotiations, on which we sadly do not sense much appetite in this organisation. ***13. I would now proceed to addressing some of the more specific issues raised, organised again into 10 blocks. Block 1 - Agriculture: 14. Firstly, on agriculture issues, I noted several interventions by Members, relating to the three pillars and welcoming the continuous process of CAP reform: domestic support, market access and export competition.15. Let me start by domestic support. 16. The decline in the use of public intervention operated by the EU is a result of the change in policy orientation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) from product (price) support (through market intervention measures) towards producer support through direct income support. Reforms of the CAP since the early 1990s have changed the public intervention policy, decreasing both the administered prices and buying in quantities and completely eliminating the system for some products. 17. This trend is reflected in the changes in the structure of the CAP budget where the share of market intervention measures (including export refunds) declined from 100% of total CAP expenditure in 1980 to below 5% in 2011. Is also reflected in the EU's notified domestic support where the current total Aggregated Measure Support (AMS) has decreased dramatically. Today, market intervention measures can only be used as a safety net mechanism. It was in this sense that the mechanism was triggered in 2014 and 2015, but only, for certain fruit and vegetables, in response to the Russian import ban and in reaction to the dramatic global price fall for dairy products.18. Most CAP support is notified as Green Box compliant decoupled income support, which is granted to farmers in the form of decoupled direct payments with no obligation to produce. The latest ""DS:1 notification"" of the EU reported very limited support in the Amber Box (less than € 6 bn, 95% of which was for Market Price Support to wheat, butter and skimmed milk powder).19. In addition, I would like to refer to the end of the last two remaining production quotas in the CAP for milk and sugar, both of which are supressed. As a consequence, EU prices will align even further with world prices. 20. In the light of these developments and the EU's efforts over the years, I would emphasise my expectation and hope that other WTO Members would undertake the same level of reforms in agriculture.21. Some delegations referred to the fact that EU subsidies under the Amber Box have not decreased based on OECD data. I would like to underline that the OECD methodology is quite different from the logic of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. I strongly believe that policies conducted under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture and reviewed in the TPR, should be assessed under WTO criteria. And here the trend is crystal clear – an enormous shift has occurred in recent years from EU Amber Box support to non-trade distorting Green Box support. Some Members may call this box shifting. I rather call this ""good policy"" which is in the EU's interest and in your interest. To summarise: you should ask yourselves whether you would prefer Members who still maintain high levels of trade distorting Amber Box support to maintain such measures or would you prefer that they move toward non-trade distorting Green Box support. The answer I think is clear.22. In relation to market access in agriculture, I think it is important to emphasise that the EU is today the world's largest importer of agriculture products, with imports of more than € 112 bn in 2016.  In addition, the EU has concluded and continues to negotiate ambitious FTA agreements to reduce agricultural tariffs in bilateral trade.23. The EU import regime for agricultural products is fully transparent and predictable and is contained in the EU's schedule, as accepted and bound as part of the Uruguay Round Agreement.  The EU has only a limited number of tariff peaks, which were accepted and bound as part of the Uruguay Round Agreement. 24. With regard to TRQ management and concerns on low fill rates, I would like to clarify that those may result from market conditions such as competitive domestic production. Several of these TRQs presenting an under fill rate below 65%, are already managed on a first-come-first-served basis in line with the decision taken in Bali. TRQs including fill rates as well as TRQs managed by licenses are notified each year to the WTO. 25. New Zealand mentioned in its statement its concerns regarding tariffs on dairy products. I commend New Zealand for taking the time to convert some of our 'specific' tariffs into ad valorem equivalents. I would highlight in response that no changes have actually occurred to our specific tariffs for the goods concerned. These are in fact bound in our schedule. Any changes that New Zealand has recorded must therefore be the result of external factors such as the value of the imported product or the relevant exchange rate. 26. In relation to export competition, EU legislation is already in full compliance with the Nairobi outcome. As mentioned, no agricultural export subsidies have been granted since July 2013. Block 2 - Fisheries: 27. Secondly, on our Common Fisheries Policy, I am pleased to note that there was a general recognition of the EU's 2013 reform as a step in the right direction, towards greater sustainability and science based management of the resources. 28. The EU is dedicated to addressing the issue of excess of capacity that is also set out in SDG 14.6. I am very pleased to mention today that the EU has just submitted a revision of its original fisheries subsidies proposal to the Rules Negotiating Group in view of MC11. 29. I have noted Iceland's comment regarding our fish tariffs, the average of which is 12%. As mentioned in the general part of my statement, further tariff concessions should be the subject of comprehensive tariff negotiations. Unilateral “disarmament” of tariffs is not an option at this stage. Block 3 - Trade defence: 30. Third, several important questions were raised regarding our trade defence measures.31. In a world where a level playing field is a distant dream, where dumping is more common that we would like, and where massive amount of subsidies are threatening the competitiveness of our businesses and leading to overcapacity, trade defence will remain an integral and necessary part of our trade policy. Such tools will remain in place and will continue to be used until others reign in their policies.32. China referred in its statement to the need to live up to commitments. I fully agree and the EU has taken the necessary steps to fulfil its obligations. The issue is now subject to dispute settlement, so it would be inappropriate to comment further apart from saying that the EU will vigorously and staunchly defend its legislation. I would refer here again to compliance with notification obligations regarding subsidies being provided by Members. In the case of China, the last notification was made in 2015 and covered the period 2009-2014, and even this in a non-exhaustive manner. 33. Several questions were also raised regarding the Commission's capacity to self-initiate anti-dumping investigations. The EU's legal framework indeed provides for the possibility for the Commission to initiate anti-dumping investigations itself without having received a complaint. If the level of evidence available to the Commission is comparable to the level of evidence which would be required from a complainant to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation. In practice, it is exceptional that the Commission initiates anti-dumping cases by itself.      34. A few Members also asked questions regarding amendments to our anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations. Here we have on the table our 2013 TDI modernisation proposal and the more recent 2016 proposal on the methodology to calculate dumping. The legislative process on both proposals is ongoing in the Council and European Parliament. I hope that agreement on the revisions will be reached by the end of the year. Block 4 – Investment: 35. Fourth, a few Members referred to the EU's investment policy and to the need to ensure clarity and legal certainty with regard to the 1400 existing BITs. This is a very valid point which the EU takes very seriously. 36. Since foreign direct investment policy is an integral part of the EU's common commercial policy, new investment negotiations with third countries should generally only be carried out at EU level. In order to ensure stability, the existing BITs between EU Member States and third countries remain in force and will continue to be preserved until they are replaced by EU agreements. 37. Finally, some Members rightly pointed to the need for clarity and predictability regarding the question of exclusive EU competence in view of the recent ECJ opinion on the Singapore case. The Court's ruling indeed provided clarity to on the issue of EU competences on trade and investment. The details were set out in my statement on Wednesday and in several responses to your written questions. Today, I would emphasise that while I understand that this is an important issue, it is in fact an issue of internal EU governance. It will not affect the fact that you will continue to negotiate with the European Union. Block 5 - SPS and TBT: 38. Five, with regard to SPS and TBT issues, I want to thank the Discussant, Canada, and other Members who acknowledged the improvements we have made to our legislation – particularly on animal and plant health. 39. Some of you commented on our use of risk assessment. EU SPS measures are science-based and they are adopted in accordance with the internationally recognised principles of risk analysis. The EU's risk assessor, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is an independent source of scientific advice on risks associated with the food chain. The risk managers (European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Member States) then adopt the appropriate risk management decisions on the basis of EFSA's risk assessments.40. Concerning the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides, the EU sets MRLs as low as reasonably achievable for the protection of consumers. This means that if a substance is not approved in the EU, the MRLs for the substance are set at the level of detection. The EU has circulated an information note to all WTO Members explaining in detail the process of applying import tolerances.41.  Concerning endocrine disruptors, the regulatory process for the adoption of the draft criteria to identify endocrine disruptors in chemical substances is ongoing. Discussions on the proposal providing for a derogation possibility from the criteria (i.e. the modification from 'negligible exposure' to 'negligible risk') will be resumed once the criteria have been adopted. This is an ongoing process in the EU with no final decision yet adopted. 42. On GMOs, I am happy to say that the system has actually accelerated over the last year and that the Commission is looking at the existing procedures to improve the efficiency and transparency of the process. In 2016 there were 11 new authorisations. 10 of these were for imported food and feed uses, and 1 for cut flowers. I would also like to highlight, that on 4 July 2017 the Commission adopted five more authorisations for GMOs for food and feed use: 2 GM cottons, 2 new GM maizes and the renewal of one GM maize.  43. There were also a number of very specific questions on SPS matters. I will try to answer these briefly here and suggest that the individual countries concerned follow up, if necessary, with the EU Delegation in the margins of the SPS Committee which meets here next week.44. Firstly, India mentioned anthroquinone in tea and reported that EU consumers were being deprived of the wonderful taste of Darjeeling. It has not yet been demonstrated whether the residues of anthraquinone found in tea are due to its unauthorised use as a pesticide, or because of inappropriate processing, or even because of environmental contamination. Based on scientific evidence, we doubled the MRL for anthroquinone in tea in 2015. The EU is ready to assist non-EU countries on the analytical methods or on any other technical information that would be needed to achieve the level of residues requested by us. This offer was already expressed to Chinese and Indian authorities in 2015 and 2016, respectively. I would also refer to our written answers to questions 22-24 from Indonesia on this point.45. Secondly, both Vietnam and India asked about the basis for our setting an MRLs for tricyclazole in rice. In 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a Peer review on the substance in which the non-renewal of the substance was suggested. On the basis of this assessment, the EU decided to set the MRL at the default level of 0.01 mg/kg. In so doing, we recognised the specific growing conditions for basmati rice and delayed the entry of force of the new MRL to accommodate that. And, as I mentioned a moment ago, the EU is ready to assist non-EU countries on the analytical methods or on any other technical information that would be needed to reach the residues levels required by us. 46. Thirdly, Nepal asked if we could have reduced SPS requirements for LDCs. Here the EU is committed to act in line with Article 10 of the SPS Agreement concerning special and differential treatment. The EU is also a major provider of technical assistance to help LDCs build their SPS capacities but there cannot be a general exemption for LDCs.  47. Fourthly, Peru had asked why foods that were not on the EU market in May 1997 were subject to the EU Novel Foods Regulations. The new novel food regulation provides for a simplified procedure for placing on the EU market traditional foods from third countries. This procedure provides a faster and more proportionate safety assessment and allows traditional biodiversity foods to be authorised in the EU by a simple notification once the history of safe use in at least one non-EU country has been demonstrated. This is an important improvement to the current situation where such traditional foods need to undergo the full authorisation procedure. 48. I would now like to come back to the discussant's question regarding the compliance of the EU with TBT obligations, in particular his reference to the need to wait for six months (following the date that it has been notified to the TBT Committee) before adopting a draft measure. Allow me to clarify: the TBT Agreement does not entail an obligation for a six month waiting period between the notification of a draft measure and its adoption. Article 2.9.2 of the Agreement, the transparency cornerstone on TBT notifications, refers only to an obligation to notify draft measures with a significant effect on trade which are not based on an international standard. There is no 6-month requirement. The Appellate Body has never pronounced on any time requirement with regard to Art. 2.9.2. It has, however, pronounced on a 6-month requirement for Art. 2.12 in US-Clove Cigarettes, to which we consider the discussant hints at; but that requirement concerns the ""reasonable interval"" between publication and entry into force. 49. Regarding the US remark that EU assistance to third countries would be conditioned on the recipient's acceptance of EU standards, I would have to disagree. We have received several questions on this issue from the US and provided written replies. It is clear that our European neighbours naturally consider regional integration with the EU as being conducive to their economic development and applying EU standards is a logical means to ensuring simplified access to the EU market. History shows that all countries which have either joined the EU as full Members or integrated to some extent with the EU Single Market have benefitted from it in terms of their economic growth. Block 6: Sustainable development, environment and climate: 50. Six, many Members referred to the EU's focus on sustainable development and our position on environmental and climate issues.51. Here, I would recall that sustainability remains a top priority for EU trade policy. The EU will continue to reinforce its agenda to promote sustainable development, human rights and good governance, in the spirit of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We will continue to focus on environmental and climate priorities, and support eligible developing countries through our GSP scheme. 52. We welcome the numerous expressions of support made by Members regarding further progress in EGA negotiations. The EU remains committed to this process and calls on involved Members to properly re-engage to bring negotiations to a successful close. On climate issues, the EU remains fully and unequivocally committed to implementing the Paris Climate Convention.53. With regard to the EU's duty-free quota-free scheme for LDCs exports, which is known as the Everything But Arms initiative, I would like to recall that it is the most advanced, ambitious and far-reaching unilateral preference given by any Member to the LDCs. There are currently 49 beneficiaries of the scheme. 54. As mentioned in my opening statement, the EU has a comprehensive policy of providing support to developing countries and particularly the LDCs. Unilateral concessions are one element; our broad Aid for Trade and development aid scheme constitute another. Block 7 - Customs: 55. Seven, numerous comments were made about the Union Customs Code and the implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement.56. The EU is a staunch supporter of the Trade Facilitation Agreement. We continue to be strongly committed to assisting developing countries implement the agreement. Hence, we will continue to provide technical and financial assistance to make this objective a reality.57. The EU remains dedicated to introducing further improvements in our customs regime. The new Union Customs Code (UCC) responds to this objective. It aims to address the challenges of today including increasing trade volumes and value chains by providing tools that simplify customs procedures. The UCC takes an important step forward in the direction of ensuring uniform application of customs rules, within nevertheless the context of an EU system composed of 28 separate customs administrations. Block 8 - IPR: 58. Eight, on intellectual property, the discussant and some Members have noted the impact which imports of counterfeit and pirated goods have on the EU market and emphasized the general need to address infringements of intellectual property rights in the online environment, in particular as regards copyrights. Let me assure you that important work was undertaken to further modernize the legislative framework for copyright protection and enforcement with a particular focus on copyright-protected goods in the online environment. For this purpose, a number of legislative proposals were submitted by the European Commission in September 2016. Meanwhile, work progressed also on the review of the IPR enforcement regime in the EU, again with a particular focus on the need to adapt the regime to respond to challenges in the online environment. In recognition of the key role that intellectual property rights play in the EU economy, we remain fully committed to continue our efforts in this regard.59. There have also been questions raised on the EU trademark reform package and the possibility to interrupt goods in transit in the EU, in particular as regards generic medicines. Let me first clarify that the new rules do not raise obstacles to legitimate trade in non-infringing goods, including legitimately traded generic medicines. The new trademark provisions on goods in transit apply only in respect of goods which bear without authorisation a trademark which is identical with an EU trademark or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from that trademark. The new rules do not apply to other intellectual property rights such as patents and designs.60. Regarding the statements made by delegates in relation to GIs, let me start by saying that the EU trade policy promotes protection of Geographical Indications in support of producers of products sold domestically and at international level. However, GIs are not an EU-only interest. Many countries, including developing countries, are convinced that GI protection adds value to the product. The EU system of GI protection is open to applications by third countries. 61. The reciprocal protection of GIs under bilateral trade agreements helps to secure the intellectual property rights of producers, prevents unfair competition, and meets consumer expectations for such products. It should also be noted that under such agreements, prior right holders' interests are respected and generic terms in either territory are excluded from protection. 62. In relation to the possible extension of GIs from agricultural to non-agricultural products, there is no final decision yet despite big interests by some trade partners. Block 9: - Single market and digital single market: 63. Nine, as also acknowledged by some of you on Wednesday, the Single Market is one of Europe’s greatest achievements, designed to allow goods, services, capital and people to move freely. Its effectiveness and preservation is at the heart of the European project and we are continuing working to adapt it to today's realities.  64. Among several actions under the Single Market Strategy, the European Commission has made it a priority to create a Digital Single Market. In particular, actions are taken for facilitating cross-border e-commerce, especially for SMEs, and to tackling geo-blocking: too many Europeans cannot use online services that are available in other EU countries; or they are re-routed to a local store with different and normally higher prices. These issues are still pending in the EU institutions. Block 10 - Services: 65. Regarding India's call for the EU Member States to implement the Intra-Corporate Transfer (ICT) directive, it is important to stress that several individual EU Member States already had national rules in place for admitting intra-corporate transferees and that the Directive simply replaces these with a harmonised, EU-wide scheme which simplifies and improves the situation as it offers mobility between EU Member States for non-EU staff (excluding UK, IE and DK that opted out). The Commission is actively monitoring the implementation of this important directive by Member States. Other issues: 66. Finally, before concluding, I would like to address a number of other specific issues that have been raised. 67. On government procurement, EU Member States publish on the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) platform all contracts with a total value above the GPA thresholds. The contracting authority may also publish below thresholds contracts in TED on a voluntary basis.  This is the reason behind very different shares of a total member's procurement published in TED. 68. The rules for the EU's prior surveillance mechanism for certain steel products were discussed at length both at the Committee on Import Licensing and at the Committee on Safeguards. The purpose of this scheme is to collect information about the intention to import from all non-EU member countries (with the exception of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the European Economic Area). This data is necessary to deal with the vulnerability of the EU steel market to sudden changes on world steel markets. 69. The prior surveillance regulation was recently amended to increase the exemption threshold up to 5000 kg for certain products. This will reduce the number of transaction falling under surveillance. Furthermore, the amended law explicitly encourages national authorities to accept handling the procedure in a paperless way. The European Commission is also working in parallel on a draft interpretative notice to respond to requests for clarification received from stakeholders and to ensure the uniform interpretation of existing surveillance rules.70. The discussant referred to the shipment of hazardous waste. The EU is fully in compliance with the Basel Convention and has set out a detailed legal framework for dealing with hazardous waste in the Waste Shipment Regulation. The EU has notified its scheme in its annual questionnaire on its import license procedures. The question raised – although legitimate in nature - does not therefore refer to our legal environment, but rather to enforcement activities. In this context, if the discussant or other WTO Members are in the possession of specific information regarding unlawful shipments, I would urge them to contact the relevant authorities in the EU. 71. Russia raised a question regarding unsafe third-country nuclear power plants. I have taken note of Russia's views regarding the written response provided. I would however reiterate that the question relates to a measure taken only very recently and that the EU's principles regarding transparency, due process and the rule of law actually require minimum of time to investigate the matter. 72. With regard to Russia's question on the North Stream 2 pipeline, the Commission has not disputed that the EU Gas Directive from 2009 does not explicitly apply to offshore parts of pipelines bringing gas from third countries to the EU, even though the Commission has expressed on many occasions that this project is not in line with the EU's Energy Union objectives and it does not therefore see the need for new gas infrastructure projects of such magnitude. I would add that on 9 June 2017, the Commission submitted to the Council a recommendation for a mandate to enter into negotiations with the Russian Federation on the conclusion of an international agreement concerning North Stream 2, which would ensure that the project is not operated in a legal void or according to a third country's energy laws only. 73. With regard to Russia's questions on autonomous measures for Ukraine, these were taken in the context of our bilateral trade liberalisation efforts, which are compatible with GATT Article XXIV. Our recent measures were driven by the fact that Ukraine could not fully profit from our DCFTA given the disruption and extraordinary fall in the GDP of Ukraine in 2014 and 2015.  74. And finally, many Members expressed their concerns and wishes regarding the Brexit issue. Here I would reiterate what we have said in our written responses. 75. Following the UK Government's formal notification to the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the EU, negotiations have now started. Until its withdrawal, the UK remains a Member State of the European Union with all rights and obligations of a Member State. We will revert to the WTO Membership at an appropriate moment in the future after engaging with the UK bilaterally. ***76. Finally, I would take this opportunity to thank you once again for all the comments made and questions raised. The EU considers this exercise to be important for broader transparency in this organisation. Nevertheless, we should remember that the TPR is not the only occasion for a frank discussion. Numerous points made over the last few days could equally well be addressed by experts in the context of the WTO's regular committee work. I would urge Members to fully engage in these regular discussions. I would  further ask that Members take the time to get acquainted with the written responses that we have provided and will provide to the well over 1000 questions we have received for this TPR. 77. The EU is committed to making the TPR process effective and useful. We have made several suggestions on how this could be achieved during the latest TPRM appraisal. We would encourage Members to also look for possible ways of further improving the process.78. The EU stands ready to provide further clarifications either today or in the future. Thank you. Geneva"
The European Union backs the Kyrgyz Bar's  strategy to protect lawyers' rights and increase ethical standards,29.06.2017,29.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/29133_en,,"On 30 June 2017, Osh will host a round table «On the protection of lawyers’ rights and ethical standards of the legal profession», organised by the EU-Central Asia Rule of Law Platform, in cooperation with the Kyrgyz and the Paris Bars. The objective of the round-table is to provide exposure to best European practices in the area of protection of the rights of lawyers and ethical standards and to propose related recommendations aimed both at lawyers themselves and at decision makers, and the public in general. The round-table would therefore contribute to reinforcing the independence of lawyers and to strengthening the rule of law in the Kyrgyz Republic. Experts from France, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic will engage in a dialogue and will exchange information on the laws and practices of their countries, with emphasis of relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Co-chaired by Board Members of the Kyrgyz and the Paris Bars, the round-table will pursue the cooperation between the Kyrgyz and Paris Bars initiated with the signing of a Partnership Agreement in October 2015, under the auspices of the Rule of Law Platform. The Partnership Agreement’s objective is for the two Bars to support each other and their Members, on all matters of mutual interest relating to the exercise of the profession of lawyer, the development of the law and practice pertaining to the rule of law and the administration of justice and substantive developments in the law itself, both in France and Kyrgyzstan and at international level. As emphasised by EU High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini, “defendants should be granted full access to full defense rights.” Core principles regulating the legal profession are the basis of the deontology of the European legal profession, and which contribute to shaping the European but also the Central Asian lawyer. They are essential to the newly-established legal professions of Central Asia that are struggling to establish their independence; and to increase understanding among lawyers of the importance of the lawyer’s role in society. The EU-Central Asia Rule of Law Platform project acts as a support mechanism to facilitate policy dialogue and promote the measures contributing to legal reforms in each of the Central Asian countries. The Platform is being funded by the European Union to the amount of EUR 1.8 million and is implemented by IBF International Consulting.  Osh"
Russia: EU prolongs economic sanctions by six months,28.06.2017,,http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/06/28-eu-sanctions-russia,http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/23959/sanctions-against-russia_ru.pdf,"  On 28 June 2017, the Council prolonged economic sanctions targeting specific sectors of the Russian economy until 31 January 2018 . This decision follows an update from President Macron and Chancellor Merkel to the European Council of 22-23 June 2017 on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. This paved the way for the renewal of sanctions for a further six months. The Council formalised this decision today by written procedure and, in line with the rule for all such decisions, unanimously . The measures were originally introduced on 31 July 2014 for one year in response to Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine. They were strengthened in September 2014. They target the financial, energy and defence sectors, and the area of dual-use goods . On 19 March 2015, the European Council agreed to link the duration of the sanctions to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, which was foreseen to take place by 31 December 2015. Since this did not happen, and given that the Minsk agreements have still not been fully implemented, the Council has extended the sanctions. The economic sanctions prolonged by this decision include: In addition to these economic sanctions, several EU measures are also in place in response to the crisis in Ukraine including: This website is the official website of the Council of the EU and the European Council.

First EU-Russia Conference “ENERGY TRANSITION: THE NEW PARADIGM” opens on Thursday in Moscow,28.06.2017,28.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/28945_en,,"On June 29, International Conference “ENERGY TRANSITION: THE NEW PARADIGM”, organized by SKOLKOVO Energy Center together with the Delegation of the European Union to the Russian Federation, Embassies of the Member States of the European Union to the Russian Federation (Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Finland)  and Higher School of Economics begins in Moscow in the framework of the “EU Climate Diplomacy Week”. The Climate Diplomacy Week is a global initiative of the EU aimed at engaging new partners  - general public, business community, civil society and NGOs - in a global community dedicated to tackle climate challenges, promote sustainability agenda and maintain high political momentum for climate action after 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The objectives of the conference are to focus both on the global developments and the possible effects on the Russian energy market, to assess technical potentials, costs benefits of a diversified energy policy and supply with a higher share of renewable energy in Russia and to analyze technological, structural and policy challenges for energy transition in Russia. The conference will bring together EU and Russian energy companies, government representative, think-tanks and experts, NGOs and media and will serve as a platform for open discussion and fruitful dialogue among the Russian and EU energy industry main stakeholders, offering a great opportunity to increase the cooperation of the EU Member States with Russia on climate related subjects. The expected panelists are representing Russian Government (Ministry of Energy, Ministry for Economic Development, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, State DUMA’s Energy Committee), EU and EU countries embassies in Russia, Russian energy companies and subsidiaries of international energy companies in Russia (BP, Siemens, GasTerra, ENEL, Rosatom, Windlife, Gazprom Neft, LUKOIL, Shell etc.), research and education centers (SKOLKOVO Energy Center, Analytical Centre under the Government of the Russian Federation, HSE, EDI) and NGOs (REN21, Energy Consumers Association, RAWI, Greenpeace, WWF etc.). The participants of the conference will discuss EU-Russia actions on energy transition and climate, energy transition in the world, companies’ perspectives on energy transition and climate with the focus on making energy business green, renewable energy sources and new technologies potential in the isolated regions in Russia, challenges and opportunities offered by energy transition for Russian energy and economic policy. In the framework of the conference there will be a press conference where the  Renewables 2017 Global Status Report (GSR), the most comprehensive annual overview of the state of renewable energy in the world, published recently by international agency REN21, will be presented. Vygaudas Ušackas, the European Union ambassador to the Russian Federation commented: “The prosperity and economic growth of the European Union depend on safe, secure, sustainable and affordable energy. The Energy Union, one of the latest flagship initiatives of the EU, aims not only to reform the energy sector and promote diversification, but also to advance a true clean energy revolution. Energy efficiency is not a slogan, it is one of the most cost effective ways to support the transition to a low carbon economy and a crucial policy to implement the Paris Agreement. The key point is that renewable energy has become increasingly cost-competitive in comparison with fossil fuels. With 12,5 GW of gross additional wind capacity installed in 2016, wind has now overtaken coal as the second main source of energy in Europe (after gas) and the EU remains the second largest market globally for wind power (after China).  Besides, it is also an effective way to create investment opportunities, growth and employment. In total, the renewables sector in Europe employs over one million people, attracts more investments than many other sectors, has reduced our fossil fuels imports bill by €16 billion since 2005, and by 2030 we expect to reduce our gas imports for additional 12%. On top of that, whereas in the past we used to see a clear link between energy consumption and GDP growth - with any rise in GDP only possible with an increase in energy consumption -  in recent years we have managed to fully decouple these two elements. Whereas GDP grew by some 10% from 2005 to 2015, primary energy consumption decreased by almost 11% in the same period. Therefore it became clear that cleaner energy and economic growth can go hand in hand. To support and accelerate the global transition to a low-emission and climate-resilient future, the EU also work relentlessly to forge news partnerships around the world. We have accumulated experience in developing and implementing ambitious climate policies and we are ready to share our experiences and lessons learned”. Alexey Texler,   1st Deputy Minister of Energy of Russian Federation, commented: “We are pleased that the cooperation between the EU and Russia on renewable power generation issues is being developed. This is fundamentally important for the energy policy in the 21st century. The strategy for renewable energy sources development should become the basis for the power industry of the future. The dialogue between Russia and the EU already forms the foundation for the transformation of the global power generating industry”. Alexey Kokorin, Head of Climate and Energy Programme, WWF Russia, commented: “Cooperation with the EU is very important, primarily for the Russian wind power industry. We need to reduce the technological gap, therefore we can only welcome the fact that many Russian power generating companies are already cooperating with the European companies. The construction of large wind power stations and major investments are those factors, the implementation of which is indispensable for formation of the competencies essential for the Russian wind power industry development”. Christine Lins, Executive Secretary of REN21, commented: “The world is in a race against time. The single most important thing we could do to reduce CO2 emissions quickly and cost-effectively, is phase-out coal and speed up investments in energy efficiency and renewables. When China announced in January that it was cancelling more than 100 coal plants currently in development, they set an example for governments everywhere: change happens quickly when governments act – by establishing clear, long-term policy and financial signals and incentives. Increased cooperation between EU Member States with Russia on renewable energy will help the region not only address climate concerns but will help position it to be leader in the energy transition.” Tatiana Mitrova, Director of Energy Centre, SKOLKOVO Business School, commented: “The solutions to the challenges for the world energy could be found only through the joint actions of all the stakeholders who are interested in the stable and continuous development of the energy sector. We as the co-organizers of this event see our mission in helping to start dialogue between EU and Russia on the transition to the new architecture of the energy sector, that can help make a world tomorrow a far better place than today’’.

The 36 obstacles created in 2016 could affect EU exports that are currently worth around €27 billon. According to the Report on Trade and Investment Barriers released today by the European Commission, thanks to its effective Market Access Strategy, the Commission succeeded last year in removing as many as 20 different obstacles hindering European exports. (...) The Trade and Investment Barriers Reports are published annually since the beginning of the 2008 economic crisis. This year's edition is fully based on concrete complaints received by the Commission from European companies. They concern a wide range of products covering everything from agri-food to shipbuilding industries. G20 members figure prominently among countries having created the highest number of import obstacles. Russia, Brazil, China and India top the list.

International Yoga Day on 21 June 2017 | Research project funded by the European Union contributing to better understanding of yoga and its benefits,21.06.2017,21.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/28520_en,,"International Yoga Day on 21 June 2017 Research project funded by the European Union contributing to better understanding of yoga and its benefits Dr James Mallinson, Lecturer at London University and ERC grantee says: Yoga's history shows it to be a transformative spiritual technology that anyone can use. By increasing global awareness of yoga, the International Day of Yoga is bringing uplift to humanity. Millions of people in India, in Europe and around the world are celebrating today the International Day of Yoga, created in December 2014 by the United Nations at the initiative of India. Many Europeans practice yoga, which has deep roots in India and can provide benefits to anyone in the world. As such yoga can contribute to better understanding and cultural exchanges between Europeans and Indian citizens and strengthen people-to-people contacts. At this occasion the European Union wishes to highlight a very particular research project which the European Research Council (ERC), a programme within the Scientific Excellence pillar of the EU's Research and Innovation Programme 'Horizon 2020', is supporting, aiming at a better understanding of the roots of yoga, through mapping and studying Sanskrit manuscripts and fieldwork. The project will identify yoga’s aims and benefits and show how they have adapted to changing historical contexts.      The project is led by Dr James Mallinson, a Sanskritist by training who specialises in the history of yoga. He is based at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in the University of London. As principal investigator he is supported by a multi-disciplinary team in Europe and in India (École française d'Extrême Orient in Pondicherry and the Mehrangarh Trust in Jodhpur).   The project is running for five years from October 2015 to September 2020. It is hoped that the project’s findings will be disseminated as exhibitions in Europe and India. It is also hoped that the project’s findings will be disseminated through collaboration with the Indian government's AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) Ministry.  Background on Hatha Yoga: Aim and deliverables Hatha yoga consists of a variety of practices in which physical techniques predominate. These techniques include the postures for which yoga is now so famous, internal cleansing techniques and different ways of controlling the breath. Like other methods of yoga, hatha yoga’s teachings also include meditation. It is the physical methods of hatha yoga that provide the basis for much of the yoga practised around the world today. Hatha yoga, as taught in its Sanskrit texts, has benefits ranging from the mundane, such as a slim and healthy body, to the transcendental, i.e. enlightenment. Its techniques aim at controlling the body's vital energies, thereby prolonging life; in some texts they are even said to bring about immortality. Through analysis of ten key Sanskrit texts on hatha yoga, which are currently available only in manuscripts, and through fieldwork with traditional yogis in India today, the Hatha Yoga Project will delineate the history and practice of hatha yoga. This history is fascinating in itself, but it is also of interest to the huge number of practitioners of yoga around the world today. Some of modern yoga’s practices are twentieth-century innovations so by identifying what constituted hatha yoga in India prior to yoga’s engagement with the wider world; we will be able to point out what is new and what is old in modern yoga practice. The project’s outputs will include ten critical editions and translations of key Sanskrit texts on yoga, and four monographs on physical yoga's history.  EU –India cooperation on Research and Innovation India is a strategic partner for the European Union and this is also well reflected in the cooperation on research and innovation. India and the EU have very similar objectives on the role of research and innovation, in particular a focus on delivering economic growth faster and bringing solutions for the well-being of its citizens by addressing together the societal challenges we are facing today. In the coming years we expect to engage more actively in research and innovation collaboration, in particular building upon the good cooperation on water and scaling up cooperation on renewable energy, health and bio-economy in the EU's research and Innovation Programme Horizon 2020. In the ERC programme, which is an integral part of Horizon 2020, India is already performing well: in total, 38 Indian researchers have obtained an ERC funded projects so far (since 2007- May 2017). India is the fifth country after the US, Canada, Russia and Australia in number of successful ERC grants. In addition, more than 1100 Indians are working as a member in ERC teams across Europe. The ERC provides EU-funded opportunities to both early-career and senior researchers to carry out their research projects in all scientific disciplines in institutions across Europe. The ERC stands for scientific excellence as can be demonstrated by the following track record: - Six Nobel Prizes laureates have benefitted from ERC grants - Five ERC grantees have received the Wolf Prizes - Four ERC grantees have received the Field medals Prizes, and - More than hundred thousand articles in scientific journals have been published.  India's goods track record in ERC is a demonstration of its scientific excellence.  New Delhi"
Remarks by HR/VP Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,19.06.2017,19.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/28430_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council Check against delivery! Je vais commencer en Français pour revenir sur un point que j'ai soulevé ce matin lorsque j'ai dit que notre travail aujourd'hui était concentré aussi sur l'Afrique et le Sahel. Cela se passe quelques heures après l'attaque terroriste à Bamako, à propos de laquelle j'avais dit ce matin qu'il y avait la possibilité d'avoir des victimes européennes. Malheureusement, je peux confirmer qu'il y a 2 victimes parmi nos collègues de l'Union européenne: une victime portugaise (un soldat) qui faisait partie de la mission de formation de l'Union européenne [EUTM Mali] à Bamako, que j'avais visitée il y a deux semaines au Mali, et une collègue malienne qui travaillait pour la délégation de l'Union européenne. Cela démontre la force de la solidarité entre l'Union européenne et le Mali, ainsi que le Sahel; une solidarité qui n'est pas seulement politique mais aussi dans les faits. Nous travaillons ensemble sur le terrain, chaque jour, dans un endroit compliqué, difficile, dangereux aussi. Je voudrais adresser non seulement mes condoléances mais aussi le respect et l'admiration de toute l'Union européenne et aussi de nos collègues du Mali et du Sahel, pour le travail que nos collègues font dans la région et en particulier à Bamako – un travail précieux. J'étais en contact toute la matinée avec le Ministre des affaires étrangères du Mali [Abdoulaye Diop] qui m'a exprimée ses condoléances pour la perte que nous avons eu mais aussi toute son appréciation et l'appréciation du peuple du Mali pour le soutien que l'Union européenne est en train de donner à la lutte contre le terrorisme. Nous avons plus ou moins 500 personnes de l'Union européennes; 22 Etats Membres et 5 Etats qui ne sont pas membres de l'UE participent à notre mission militaire de formation EUTM Mali à Bamako, aux côtés du travail de la délégation de l'Union européenne et de celui de la mission civile [EUCAP Mali], toujours à Bamako. C'est un des prix à payer – l'unité de l'Union européenne, du Mali et du Sahel, comme je le disais, est forte et nous allons continuer à travailler ensemble chaque jour pour éviter que les terroristes l'emportent et nous sommes ensemble, unis dans la douleur et aussi dans la réaction et dans notre travail. I will switch to English to say that, with the Ministers, we focused also today on counter-terrorism. We adopted Council conclusions, so common decisions of the EU Member States, stressing the need to continue expanding our network of counter-terrorist experts in our delegations, focusing on some geographical priorities namely Middle East, North Africa, Western Balkans and Turkey but also Sahel, Horn of Africa and Gulf. This is a work that we will continue to do together with the Member States. I have updated Member States on the implementation of the Global Strategy [of the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy], on the counterterrorism, as well as well as our work on security and defence, on migration - other elements of work are part of the Global Strategy implementation. We have presented a report: one year of action following a common shared vision on our global role. In one year, we have seen that the world needs the European Union much more than we even imagined one year ago and this gives us a big responsibility, a big opportunity. We have started to translate our common vision into common action, namely on security and defence, strengthening the European defence pillar, also in partnership with NATO – we discussed this today with the Deputy Secretary General of NATO Rose Gottemoeller on behalf of the Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg. We presented together a report on the 42 actions that the European Union and NATO undertook in these last months namely on hybrid threats, but also on strategic communication, on maritime operations' coordination between Operation Sophia and See Guardian in the Mediterranean in particular, on cyber-defence and on the work we are doing to train our partners. So, never as now, EU and NATO have been cooperating as a matter of norm and not exception. This is also part of the implementation of our Global Strategy as well as it is the work that we have been doing – as I said – on counter-terrorism or on migration. I have shared with the Ministers the 4th report on our partnership frameworks, the [Migration] Compacts, we have developed with countries of origin and transit in Africa. It is going to be a work that will continue to require a joint effort by all Member States, by all EU institutions, but that is presenting the first results in terms of common management of a phenomenon that is particularly complex. I shared with the Ministers a couple of numbers that I will share also with you, just to give you a sense of direction of the trends. Last year, in May 2016, there were 70 000 migrants crossing Niger and then moving into Libya and then probably towards the Mediterranean. This year, in May, we are at 5 000. So, we went down from 70 000 to 5 000 migrants crossing Niger thanks to an excellent cooperation and partnership with the authorities of Niger and the strong work we have done especially in Agadez to offer economic alternatives but also to support the joint Sahel efforts to control the territory. Another number of which I am particularly pleased about: in Libya, we have moved from 2 000 assisted voluntary returns from Libya to countries of origin that were done in the whole year of 2016 to 4 500 in the first months of this year, so more than the double. Here we are talking about people that were saved, offered an alternative by the IOM and the UNHCR with the logistical and financial support of the European Union and that chose to return to their home countries. And to add one other number, the Libyan coastguards saved and rescued more than 16 000 migrants in the recent months following our training and the delivery of vessels. This is not to say that the situation is solved – far from that. We still have enormous work to do. We see too many people dying in the desert and at sea, and we are seeing too many people still in the hands of the smugglers. But the action that Member States, EU institutions have put in place in the last year, together and in partnership with the countries of origin and transit, is starting to give important results. I will report on that also to the European Council at the end of the week. And I expect that all Member States will continue to invest in solidarity and in cooperation because only together we can hope to face this challenge, together with our friends in Africa and elsewhere in the world in a constructive, respective and fruitful manner. Today we had a very intense agenda, we tackled 3 other issues. One is the work we do on climate change. You will find decisions, conclusions that ministers have adopted today, among many other things on climate change. The European Union believes this is part of our work on security – as I repeated many times in these recent weeks. And we are committed all together to not only implement the Paris Agreement, but also to network with our partners around the world, with our friends around the world to make sure that there are global alliances of states and non-state actors – to make sure that climate action continues as strongly as before if not even more. The last two points: we have taken decisions on Iraq to increase our work in support of the Iraqi authorities – especially in a critical moment for the fight against Da'esh in Iraq. I would stress one point on which I have understood there is quite some attention from media which is the decision we have taken to examine the deployment of a European Union security sector reform advice and assist team. To assist – as the name says – in the reform work of the Iraqi authorities, in cooperation and in coherence with other international partners. And that happens in response to the request by the Iraqi authorities to deploy this advisory and assistance team to accompany their work on security sector reform. Obviously there is the humanitarian, the development side of our engagement that will also increase and there is a coordinated approach especially to work on the stabilisation of the liberated areas from Da'esh in Iraq that will see the European Union stepping up its work in coordination and under request of the Iraqi authorities. Last but not least at all, we have discussed with the Ministers the crisis that has erupted in the Gulf and especially among the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] Member States. I can share with you that all 28 Ministers were fully backing the approach we have taken in the last couple of weeks, that of expressing a strong European Union interest in the stability, in the unity of the Gulf. First of all, as key interlocutors and partners in the fight against terrorism, in finding a way out of some of the conflicts of the region, starting from Syria, but also being relevant interlocutors or actors when it comes to the situation in Libya that we want to preserve from being exposed to further tensions. And partners in the fight against terrorism means also in the work to prevent financing of terrorism. All together, we encourage de-escalation and most of all we encourage all Gulf countries to engage in political dialogue without preconditions accepting the mediation role of Kuwait. We are ready to help, assist and accompany these mediation efforts in all ways that might be requested. We believe though that the region, the Gulf, has in itself the possible strengths and wisdom to find a political way out of this crisis. The European Union has the firm intention to keep strong relationships and ties with all the Gulf countries and we hope that they will manage to restore good working relations among them. I will stop here – sorry it was already very long and again we will try to keep it brief because we continue the day with a very important ministerial meeting with our Eastern partners. https://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I140280 Q&A Q. Given the fact that you have contacts with all parties in the region, do you see the end of this crisis very soon or as some Ministers said this morning, given the fact that there are a lot of problems for many years between some States of the region, that the crisis is going to be long? You know me; I know I am an optimist. I have to say that this time I see the depth of the crisis more worrying than any time before. I also think though that there is an interest from all the actors around the Gulf to find a way to solve these tensions through dialogue and find a form of cooperation. If you look at the security ties, if you look at the family ties, if you look at the double citizenships, if you look at the economic relations, if you look at the ways in which the region is interconnected on a daily basis – from energy to security, I repeat myself – you realise that there is no real alternative than cooperation in the Gulf. This is true inside the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]. In the European Union we believe this is true even beyond the GCC, but this is definitely not for today – apparently. So, indeed, it does not seem to be a crisis that is ready to be solved tomorrow. But if you look at it rationally, all parties – seen from our point of view – all parties would have a strong interest in defining a quick and political solution to these tensions, together around a negotiating table – as I said, without preconditions and counting on the excellent mediating efforts of the Emir of Kuwait [Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah] that has our full support. I discussed this with the Foreign minister of Kuwait [Sabah Al-Khalid al-Sabah] in these recent days and I am personally in contact with the Foreign Ministers of the region, from Saudi Arabia to Qatar, to the [United Arab] Emirates and further beyond. Let me add that we are extremely worried about the possible spill-over effect that these tensions could have both in the Horn of Africa, in Africa at large, some parts of Asia, in the Middle East, obviously in Libya. Our strong plea is – to our friends in the Gulf – to make reason prevail and find a way to solve any dispute or differences – that we understand and in some cases we share – to find a solution out of these tensions. Q. On Iraq, was there appetite in the Council today for a stabilisation mission and what would be the next steps if so? As I said the decision we took today is to explore, to examine the deployment of an EU Security Sector Reform Advice and Assist Team. So this is the decision we have taken, to explore this possibility of deployment rapidly in these coming months; to have an assist and advice team to accompany the Iraqi authorities on their security sector reform. This is the next step we are going to take. As I said, this is happening in response to a request by the Iraqi government and authorities and this is going to be done in cooperation with the other international partners. I could not elaborate on further steps, but this is the next step we are going to take and I hope this can be put in place rapidly enough – hopefully in the coming months – so that we can, also in the security sector reform, provide all our advice and assistance to the Iraqi authorities that are facing a complicated time. As I said, the European Union is already doing a lot both on the humanitarian, on the development, on the demining, on the recovery of the liberated areas. We are ready to do more also on the security sector reform. Q. Il semblerait qu'il y aurait une discussion au Conseil européen jeudi sur les sanctions économiques contre la Russie avec une présentation de l'évaluation de la situation sur le terrain par la France et l'Allemagne et une recommandation. Pourriez-vous donner un peu de détails sur comment cela va se passer et le renouvellement, si vous pensez que cela est dans les tuyaux? Ce n'était pas un point que les Ministres ont débattu aujourd'hui. Comme vous le savez, la procédure mais aussi le contenu de nos décisions par rapport aux sanctions liées à la situation en Ukraine n'ont pas changé, c'est-à-dire que normalement les Etats Membres prennent la décision qui est liée à la mise en œuvre des accords de Minsk, qui sont pour nous la façon de résoudre le conflit. L'Allemagne et la France, d'une certaine façon, représentent l'Union européenne en lien direct avec nous dans le format Normandie. A deux ou trois reprises, lors du Conseil européen, les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement de la France et de l'Allemagne, ensemble avec moi, ont donné leur opinion sur l'état de mise en œuvre des accords [de Minsk] et après le Conseil a adopté formellement la decision. Je dois constater qu'il n'y a pas de réelle avancée sur la mise en œuvre des accords et donc j'imagine que la décision va être prise dans le sens d'une continuation de l'état actuel des sanctions. Mais bien sûr, cela sera débattu par les Etats Membres j'imagine après le Conseil européen de la fin de semaine; nous avons le temps jusqu'à la fin juillet pour la reconduction des sanctions. Q. I have got a question on Syria because today there was a downing of a plane – a Syrian plane – by the coalition and then the Russian Foreign Ministry, Russian Defence Ministry suspended the de-conflicting mechanism with the United States. Do you have any reaction on that? Do you think it will have an impact on the Syrian talks? I just talked to Staffan de Mistura [United Nations Special Envoy for Syria] a couple of days ago about the perspective of the talks. To me, even the recent developments today are the clear demonstration of the fact that there is no alternative to a political solution that has to be negotiated in Geneva under the UN leadership. As you know very well, the European Union is not a military player in Syria and is proud not to be, because we are not the ones that are fighting in Syria, we are the ones that are delivering humanitarian aid, we are bringing the children to school, we are trying to have access to all areas of the country. And this is the work that the European Union is ready to continue in support of a political agreement to be defined by the parties under UN leadership in Geneva. We are extremely engaged with different Syrian interlocutors – in Geneva itself - including on the ways in which we can support not only from the humanitarian point of view but also from a reconciliation perspective, locally, and in the future, on reconstruction. We believe that it is extremely urgent that the parties in Geneva find a political agreement that can put an end to this war. Q. Since what has happened in Mali over the weekend and also the ongoing work with Iraq, do you see as part of the Global Strategy any role for the private security sector as a player in the Global Strategy in terms of providing aid for missions abroad, in terms of security advice? And a quick question on Russia. Where do you stand on the sanctions against Russia because of the crisis in Ukraine? Should these sanctions be extended? The decision is coming up I guess. On the second part of the question, I guess I already replied in French so maybe you can simply translate for the sake of time. On security – if I understood correctly your question – you asked me if there is a new role for the private security sector? No. No, we count on 28 Member States that have security forces, both in the military and in the civilian field, that have competences, dedication, commitment, professionalism. They are amazing – all of them. All 28 have enormous resources in this field. The loss of lives we have experienced yesterday in Mali is a tragic, but also maybe useful reminder for all Europeans of the fact that our men and women in uniform are already serving for peace and security and against terrorism in many different parts of the world - in Africa, but also elsewhere. We have to be grateful for the service they are paying and also proud for the quality of the contributions they are bringing to the security of difficult places. That is not only a gesture of solidarity with our friends – in this case brothers and sisters of Mali – but it is also an investment in our own security. This to say the European Union is increasing its work on security and defence, including our military and civilian missions and operations around the world – we have fifteen of them. We have now a unified command in Brussels that in these hours has been following and coordinating actions in Mali. So, we are increasing the EU profile on security and defence – always keeping in mind the European way to security which is never a purely military approach. You take the example of Mali. We are there with a military mission to advise the Malian security forces. By the way if you compare the reaction of the Malian security forces on the attack yesterday and the previous attack that happened in an Hotel in Bamako you would see that the security forces of Mali today are much more prepared and are taking the responsibility of their security in their hands directly – which is also an effect of our training work with them. So we are stepping up our work on security and defence. We are doing that with a mix of military, non-military, humanitarian, development, economic investments, climate change action in all places where we are present. And we are doing it, counting on our own forces that – I can tell you – today at 28, tomorrow at 27, are more than sufficient to make the European Union a security provider worldwide. Q. Sur la crise du Golfe: nous avons entendu que vous soutenez les efforts du Koweït mais nous aimerions bien savoir votre réaction à propos du blocus imposé contre un peuple et pas uniquement un Etat? Il est clair pour nous – comme je l'ai dit - que les différences et même les éléments de friction, de tension, de désaccord entre différents Etats doivent être résolus par des moyens politiques, le dialogue, l'engagement et pas avec des mesures prises unilatéralement. Nous sommes particulièrement préoccupés par les effets que ces mesures peuvent avoir sur la région surtout sur les citoyens qui ont la double nationalité, les familles mais aussi sur les liens économiques, de sécurité qui existent dans le Golfe qui lient les Etats du CCG de façon très forte et solide. En tant qu'Union européenne, nous avons intérêt à voir cette crise résolue de façon la plus rapide possible par des moyens de dialogue et d'engagement politique et surtout sans escalade des tensions et sans effets supplémentaires sur les régions voisines ou sur des crises qui sont en cours et sur lesquelles il faut, au contraire, plus de coopération entre les Etats de la région et de la part des Etats de la région avec la communauté internationale.

Thank you very much. Well, let me start by thanking the Foreign Minister [of Finland] Timo [Soini], the Prime Minister [of Finland] Juha [Sipilä]. I am really impressed by the welcoming and also by the fact that you are dedicating some of your busy time, in a busy week in Finnish politics to discuss with us the European Union's engagement in the Arctic, and I am really grateful for that. First of all because this is a special week also for me: paying two visits to Finland in one week is something quite extraordinary. We are negotiating whether we manage to keep this rhythm in the future. But it is really a pleasure to show, also with a physical presence, this European Union commitment to working together on the Arctic. It is also a pleasure to see together with us here today and, in general terms in our common work on the Arctic and on some of the global issues related to the Arctic, some of the friends that are not in the European Union but are very strong partners for us. And in particular, if I can, someone that is coming from far away, even if indeed we are neighbours across the Arctic – Chrystia [Freeland, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada] it is really a pleasure to be sharing the stage with you again, but also let me welcome our friends from Norway and Iceland. You know sometimes, we Europeans feel that the Arctic is the northern frontier of our continent. But, indeed, I believe that the Arctic is less and less a border, and is becoming a true gateway to the world. I think we couldn't be more dedicated to it in terms of the European Union institutions. If you think that, together with my good friend [European] Commissioner [for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries] Karmenu Vella, when we launched the Common Strategy of the European Union on the Arctic we were indeed noticing that a Maltese Commissioner and an Italian High Representative were focussing so much on the Arctic. I think this really shows you that the European Union is not just institutions in Brussels, it is a community of friends and people that share the same commitments and can help each other wherever our common priorities are. And you will always find the European Union at the side of all of us and of our partners wherever it is strategically important for us to be united. I think this is not an irrelevant political point to make, especially in these days. So, this is not true – the fact that the Arctic is just a border. This is not true for Europe. Europe sees the Arctic as – as I said – a gateway, a crossroad that is more and more strategically relevant for Europe but also around the world. There is a growing interest, at all latitudes, about the Arctic and the opportunities it offers. A big part of the world is looking at the Arctic. But let me for one moment reverse our perspective, because it can be eye-opening to look at the rest of the world from the Arctic, through the eyes of the peoples of these lands. It goes without saying that the 4 million inhabitants across the Arctic are not the primary drivers of climate change; that is quite clear seen from here. It is the 7 billion inhabitants living at lower latitudes and our consumption patterns, which generate massive green-house gas emissions. But it is here in the Arctic that temperatures are rising more quickly – and I am very grateful for having welcomed us with a wonderful summer day, but I think this is also telling us something. In these lands, everyone knows that climate change is real and tangible. It is not something hypothetical or fake; on the contrary, it is something very real. From here, we can see how important the Paris agreement on climate change is – for the people of the Arctic, from Finland to Alaska, from Canada to Russia, but also for the entire world. Because as the ice melts above the polar circle the sea-levels rise all around the world; floods and hurricanes become more common; new security challenges emerge at thousands of kilometres from here. And let me tell you: ten days ago I was in Africa, in the Sahel, and people there were telling me that our major security threat, together with terrorism, is climate change. So even seen from the Arctic, I think we see a clear perspective of where our political, strategic and security priorities are. So, the European Union understands the challenge. And for this reason we will continue to support the Paris agreement on climate change and we will continue to work for its full implementation – here in Europe and all around the world, building together with our partners around the world global coalitions in support of global climate action. We feel the responsibility, we live up to our responsibility and we will make it. But from here in the Arctic we can also learn something about the way forward. With two main ideas in mind: innovation, and cooperation. In this part of the world, it is particularly clear that economic development must go together with the preservation of the environment. That development has to be sustainable. This is a self-evident fact in the European Union, but here in the Arctic it is particularly clear. Innovative solutions are being tested for cleaner energy, cold-climate technologies, but also for more sustainable tourism. Innovation is also happening in the interaction among governments, private actors and civil society. And the Arctic Stakeholder Forum tomorrow is an innovation in our way to interact with many different players in the European Arctic. We want the people of the Arctic to have the major say and contribute to shaping the next European Union funding programmes, which is also not irrelevant for this part of the world. The European Union's Arctic policy has put dialogue with the indigenous people at its core, as testified by the annual dialogue between the European Union and indigenous people. Second element: cooperation. Innovation can be a matter of technologies, but it can also be a matter of governance. The Arctic Council is indeed an innovative experience, gathering together eight States and six organisations representing indigenous peoples. So far, the Arctic region has been an example of constructive cooperation, from oil spill detection to the safety of maritime routes. The European Union has contributed to this positive engagement, through a dialogue with all Arctic States, regional authorities and indigenous people. Today, this becomes even more important. As more attention turns towards the Arctic, regional cooperation must be not only preserved, but expanded. And the European Union is more than ready; as the video was telling us, we are proud and ready to do our part. And we count on the Finnish presidency of the Arctic Council to do part of this job together. So, as we can see here, in this wonderful city that I understand is also the hometown of the Prime Minister, the Arctic is not only a white surface with scattered animals. It is a place for universities, for innovative technologies, for sustainable development. It is not a frontier any longer – it is a gateway for Europe and a crossroad between continents. It is our meeting place. So it is also our common responsibility to preserve it. It is our common good, and we have a common responsibility to preserve it for its people, but also for ourselves and for the entire world – locally and globally. I thank you very much and wish you all a very fruitful two days of conference. Thank you. Oulu"
"EUDEL Statement on the criminal charges brought against Russian human rights defender Valentina Cherevatenko, delivered in the 1289th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers (14 June 2017)",14.06.2017,14.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/28226_en,,"1289th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers (14 June 2017) EUDEL Statement on the criminal charges brought against Russian human rights defender Valentina Cherevatenko  The criminal charges brought against activist Valentina Cherevatenko, a leader of the ""Union of Women of Don"" -non-governmental organisation, represent the first criminal case opened under the ""foreign agents"" law in Russia. The Russian Criminal Code provides for criminal liability punishable by up to two years of prison for non-compliance with the ""foreign agents"" law. The EU has repeatedly stated that the law on ""foreign agents"", and the practice of declaring NGOs as ""foreign agents"" further tighten the restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms in Russia, restrict and inhibit independent civil society in the country, and consume the scarce resources of NGOs. Also Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muiznieks has described the introduction of criminal sanctions as a severe penalty which can hardly be qualified as ""'necessary in a democratic society, while remaining proportionate to the offence committed."" The EU continues to call on the Russian authorities to align their policies and legislation with the human rights obligations and commitments that they have undertaken, and to abandon the practice of branding Russian NGOs as ""foreign agents"". The EU is committed to continuing its support to Russian NGOs, civil society and human rights defenders. We appreciate highly Ms Cherevatenko's outstanding work on human rights education, peace building, and humanitarian issue. The EU calls on Russia to drop all charges against Ms Cherevatenko.

Joint Press Release: EU-Ukraine Human Rights Dialogue,13.06.2017,13.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/28125_en,,"Joint Press Release: EU-Ukraine Human Rights Dialogue The European Union and Ukraine held their annual Human Rights Dialogue on 13 June 2017 in Kyiv, the third time since the signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. In the Association Agreement, the European Union and Ukraine express their mutual commitment to common values, in particular full respect for democratic principles, rule of law, good governance, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The meeting was held in an open and constructive atmosphere, allowing a thorough exchange of views on the current human rights situation in Ukraine and on progress since the last dialogue, held in July 2016. The EU and Ukraine expressed grave concern over the further deterioration of the human rights situation on the Crimean peninsula, including the situation of Crimean Tatars, following its illegal annexation by the Russian Federation. The EU and Ukraine condemned the human rights violations and abuses in the areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are not under the full effective control of the Government of Ukraine. They also called for the immediate release of illegally detained Ukrainian citizens in Russia and the Crimean peninsula. The EU and Ukraine raised ways to mitigate the humanitarian impact on civilians of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and the conflict in the east of Ukraine. They also discussed the ways to protect the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The work of the Ministry for Temporary Occupied Territories and IDPs and the Action Plan for certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, adopted by the Government of Ukraine, were welcomed. The EU and Ukraine discussed the prevention of ill-treatment and torture and thecontribution that the ongoing reforms in the area of law enforcement continue to have in strengthening human rights in Ukraine. The EU also called for further progress to be made in the investigations into the crimes committed during the EuroMaidan protests, and the violent events in Odesa on 2 May 2014, emphasising the need to address the shortcomings identified by the International Advisory Panel of the Council of Europe and to bring to justice those responsible. The EU highlighted the importance of harmonising electoral legislation and the appointment of members of the Central Election Commission whose mandate has expired. Both sides highlighted the importance of free and independent media and discussed ways to advance the safety of journalists and media outlets, including the steps taken to address publication of journalists' private data on Ukrainian websites. The decision to block a number of Russia-based online services was also addressed. Also on the agenda of the Dialogue was non-discrimination policy, including the rights of LGBTI persons and those belonging to ethnic, linguistic, religious and national minorities, and the rights of the child. Gender equality and women's rights, especially domestic violence, were raised and the EU encouraged Ukraine to ratify the Istanbul Convention. The EU and Ukraine cooperate well in international fora in the field of human rights. The European Union recalled that Ukraine has committed to the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The EU delegation was led by Mr Dirk Schuebel, Head of Division for bilateral relations with the Eastern Partnership countries in the European External Action Service. The Ukrainian delegation was led by Mr Sergui Petukhov, Deputy Minister of Justice of Ukraine. In line with usual practice, the EU held consultations with representatives of Ukrainian civil society and international organisations prior to the dialogue. In March 2017, human rights organisations from Ukraine and the EU held a civil society seminar on human rights. The recommendations of that seminar were also discussed in the dialogue. The dialogue was planned to coincide with the Justice, Freedom and Security subcommittee to be held on 14 June. The next Human Rights Dialogue meeting between Ukraine and the EU is scheduled to take place in the summer of 2018.  Kyiv"

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference at the Kulturanta talks,11.06.2017,11.06.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/28065_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference at the Kulturanta talks Check against delivery! Thank you very much. It is really a pleasure for me be back in Finland in the invitation of Mr President [of Finland, Sauli Niinistö]. It is always a pleasure to first of all engage in conversations with him personally, and to work with the Finnish government on what will be the main topic of our conversations this afternoon here which is the very strong, important work we are doing to strengthen the European Union security and defence pillar - a work that is moving fast, concretely with so many decisions that are taking shape in these days. It is excellent for me to be here and having the possibility to discuss also the way forward with Mr President. His support to this process has been consistent, credible one since years and now finally we see some of these ideas coming to reality and this is also thanks to your determination, your support and the excellent support that Finland has given to the European Union's security and defence work. It is also a pleasure for me to be here together with the Deputy Secretary General of NATO Rose [Gottemoeller]. Together with her and Jens Stoltenberg [Secretary General of NATO] we have done remarkable work to move forward also in EU-NATO cooperation that has never been as good as now, and also with my good friend [Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway,] Børge Brende with whom we work in a truly European way in all foreign and security issues. So for me it is really a pleasure to be here, to be back here. Q. You said that the cooperation as to defence and security with NATO and EU is really nicely smoothly going. It seems that Mr [Donald] Trump is pulling out from Europe. Who would defend Finland if Russia comes over the border? We had the official visit of President Trump to the European Union a couple of weeks ago; and I was impressed by the fact that Vice-President [Mike] Pence visited the EU institutions officially within the first months. I guess this is unprecedented for a US administration. This is to say that the commitment we are seeing of the US administration officially towards the European Union is strong. I would not comment on the US commitment to NATO, I would leave it to my friend Rose [Gottemoeller]. But what we are doing to strengthen the EU defence capacity has nothing to do with the US administration. It is a process we started actually with the Lisbon Treaty years ago, it is a process we re-launched exactly one year ago when I presented the Global Strategy for the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy that indicated clearly well before the elections in the United States - also before the results of the referendum in the UK - that the Europeans need the European Union to do more on defence and security because we have the means to do that and our citizens need it. I will talk about that with the President [of Finland, Sauli Niinistö] and my friends in a minute at the Conference: we are taking steps in this last couple of weeks that are completely unprecedented and that will make the European Union security and defence credibility and capacity really strong. I would say, I often repeat it: we are doing more on European Union defence in this last year than in the 10  or 15 years before and we are doing that for ourselves, not for external factors.  Q. Euroscepticism is raising and it is already really high in Europe. What makes you think that citizens in Europe and really the citizens, not the leaders, want more EU on the security and defence matters? First of all, there is a certain anti-system feeling across Europe, not only in Europe, we see it across the United States, in other parts of the world as well. This is the way in which I read what you called euroscepticism. If you look at all the latest results at elections in Europe, they do not show at all an anti-European Union feeling or movement but they show an anti-system feeling around our public opinions. I think it is absolutely necessary and urgent for the institutions – be it local, regional, national, continental, global - to analyse this feeling. Because my sense is that our citizens are feeling that the institutions are not working for them and if you look at the approval rate of local or national or European institutions, sometimes you find out that the Europeans institutions have better scores that the national or local ones. So, I guess this is a sense of how do institutions represent and respond to their citizens' needs. It is a much more deeper and probably much more difficult question to answer. Having said that, if you take the polls, all over Europe, in all the European Union, there is one field where it is absolutely uncontroversial that the European citizens want more European integration and cooperation: in the field of defence, security and foreign policy across the continent, North/South, East/West, across the political spectrum. European citizens indicate clearly – I think around 80% but I would need to check the exact numbers – that they want more Europe on defence, security and foreign policy. Why? Because our citizens understand very well that in the world of today size matters and as European Union we have the power, the capacity, the impact to face the security challenges we have in front of us, be it regional security challenges or global ones. So, it is an immediate, spontaneous demand for the European Union to be more active on the global scene and this is exactly the reason why we are doing all this work on European Union security and defence. If you want, I can share with you the numbers of the Eurobarometer of the last year, consistently in all countries, this is the big request and I think it is not by chance that our friends in the United Kingdom are showing interest in having or building a future partnership exactly on foreign and security issues in a future relationship that we will have to discuss in the future exactly on these issues. Because together, we are stronger. Q. When you are building the European defence and foreign policy together so wonderfully, it is a fact that there are countries that are in NATO and there are non-NATO countries. If there is a real military conflict, somewhere in the European Union or somewhere else it is a fact that these non NATO countries have less defence and less security as the NATO countries. How are we going to solve this two class society in the European Union? It is not for the European Union to define the defence policy or doctrine and, in some cases, even the constitutional provisions of Member States. This is clearly spelled in the treaties. It is a national, sovereign choice. It is the right and the duty of the institutions of the each and every Member State to define their own defence doctrine, their own defence policy and the military alliances they want to be part of. The majority of Member States in Europe are part of NATO, are NATO allies, some are not and it is definitely not up to me or to the European Union to argue in favor or against this. This is a national debate and a national choice. What I can say and what I can do and what we are doing together is to say whatever you are, NATO ally or not NATO ally, there is a European way, a European Union way to strengthen your capabilities in security and defence. This is what the European Union can do; and we will discuss this in a moment with the President and other friends. This is about supporting through the EU resources for instance, the development of capabilities, this is about having a joint European Union presence in some of the crisis areas as we are already doing. The European Union has fifteen military and civilian operations around the world tackling some of the crises and conflicts that seem far away, like in the Sahel or of the Horn of Africa or in the Mediterranean but then they have a direct impact in our own security, maybe a couple of weeks or months afterwards. So I cannot define what is the security and defence umbrella that every single Member State define for itself. This has to do with geography, history and politics, but what we can do is to offer the European Union support to the national Member States security and defence capacity and this is finally what we are doing.

Commission seeks a mandate from Member States to negotiate with Russia an agreement on Nord Stream 2,09.06.2017,,http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1571_en.htm,http://europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_17_1571/IP_17_1571_EN.pdf,"This site uses cookies. Visit our cookies policy page or click the link in any footer for more information and to change your preferences.  The European Commission has today adopted a request to the Council of the European Union for a mandate to negotiate with the Russian Federation the key principles for the operation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project. The Commission seeks to ensure that, if built, Nord Stream 2 operates in a transparent and non-discriminatory way with an appropriate degree of regulatory oversight, in line with key principles of international and EU energy law. The Vice-President for Energy Union Maroš Šefčovič said: "" Creating a well-diversified and competitive gas market is a priority of the EU's energy security and Energy Union strategy . As we have stated already several times, Nord Stream 2 does not contribute to the Energy Union's objectives. If the pipeline is nevertheless built, the least we have to do is to make sure that it will be operated in a transparent manner and in line with the main EU energy market rules. "" Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Cañete said: ""A s any other infrastructure project in the EU, Nord Stream 2 cannot and should not operate in a legal void or according to a third country's energy laws only. We are seeking to obtain a Council mandate to negotiate with Russia a specific regime which will apply key principles of EU energy law to Nord Stream 2 to preserve the functioning of the European internal energy market"". The Commission is committed to the Energy Union objectives, including energy security. The priority is to create a well-diversified and competitive gas market. The work to consequently dismantle barriers to trade and supporting critical gas infrastructure is ongoing. The Energy Union diversification strategy develops around priorities such as the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor, the development of a liquid gas hub in the Mediterranean and through promoting access to Liquefied Natural Gas and gas storage for which the Commission adopted a strategy in February 2016. The preference is a strong regional cooperation between the Member States and it is delivering concrete results: key gas infrastructures in the Baltic region are being implemented with financial support of the European Union, such as the Gas Interconnectors between Poland and Lithuania or the Balticconnector between Finland and Estonia. The Commission is also actively facilitating the establishment of a new northern corridor linking Norway to Poland through Denmark. Likewise the Commission is helping to abolish all barriers for the free flow of gas in Central and South East Europe and is supporting the construction of the necessary gas infrastructure in this region. The Commission considers that the Nord Stream 2 project does not contribute to the Energy Union objectives of giving access to new supply sources, routes or suppliers and that it could allow a single supplier to further strengthen its position on the European Union gas market and lead to a further concentration of supply routes. There is existing, well-functioning gas transportation infrastructure in place to ensure Europe's energy supply. Building Nord Stream 2, would, at the same time, endanger existing transport routes, notably via Ukraine. While any on-shore pipeline to transport the gas coming through Nord Stream 2 in Europe would have to be in full compliance with the EU energy rules under the so-called Third Internal Energy Market legislative package, the off-shore section of the pipeline is in a specific situation given that part of it, including its only entry point lies outside the EU jurisdiction. Therefore the Commission asks the Council of Ministers for a mandate to negotiate a special legal framework, which would take into account fundamental principles stemming from international and EU energy law. These principles include:  For More Information DG ENER website: imports and secure supplies Share this page:"

"Remarks by President Donald Tusk before the G7 summit in Taormina, Italy",26.05.2017,26.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/26994_en,,"EU News 112/2017 We are meeting here in Taormina as the G7 to discuss the most pressing global issues. There is no doubt that this will be the most challenging G7 summit in years. It is no secret that leaders who are meeting today, sometimes have very different positions on topics such as climate change and trade. But our role as the EU is to do everything to maintain the unity of the G7 on all fronts. Most importantly, unity needs to be maintained when it comes to defending the rules-based international order. Each day we are confronted with these strategic global problems that pose a threat to peace and security in Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East. From the war in Syria and Russian aggression in Ukraine, to nuclear and ballistic missile tests in North Korea, and land reclamation and militarization in the South China Sea. If our group is not determined and united enough, the situation in the world can really get out of hand. I expect that the G7 will demonstrate unity regarding the conflict in Ukraine. We fully support Ukraine's independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. A solution to this conflict can only be reached with the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Since our last G7 summit in Japan we haven't seen anything that would justify a change in our sanctions policy toward Russia. Therefore, I will appeal to the other G7 leaders to reconfirm this policy. The G7 should also remain united when it comes to ending the brutality in Syria. We should be ready to increase our efforts to defeat terrorism in Syria, and to find a political settlement. A special responsibility rests on the shoulders of those who, like Iran and Russia, have become involved in the crisis and cooperate with the Assad regime. Instead of wasting time, they should use their influence to enact a real ceasefire, stop the use of chemical weapons and ensure safe and immediate humanitarian access to all the people in need. Finally, let me say that we also need G7 unity in managing the migration crisis. This is a global challenge, but here in Sicily it is also a real, local problem. The EU's goal has been to at least keep the current level of international cooperation in addressing this crisis. Whether we will succeed, remains an open question. Thank you.

Remarks by President Donald Tusk after meeting with President Donald Trump,25.05.2017,25.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/26945_en,,"EU News 111/2017 During my meeting with President Trump, we discussed foreign policy, security, climate and trade relations. My feeling is that we agreed on many areas. First and foremost, on counterterrorism, and I am sure that I do not have to explain why. But some issues remain open, like climate and trade. And I am not 100 per cent sure that we can say today -we meaning Mr. President Trump and myself- that we have a common opinion about Russia, although when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, it seems that we were on the same line. However, my main message to President Trump was that what gives our cooperation and friendship its deepest meaning are fundamental Western values, like freedom, human rights and respect for human dignity. The greatest task today is the consolidation of the whole free world around those values, and not just interests. Values and principles first - this is what we, Europe and America, should be saying.    Twitter @EU_Commission Brussels"
Remarks by Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council (Development),19.05.2017,19.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/26516_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council (Development) Check against delivery! I would like to start by saying that this morning I just met the Special Envoy [Cho Yoon Je] of the new President of the Republic of Korea [Moon Jae-in] who sent his special envoy to the European Union to discuss perspectives on DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] and denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. And we have had excellent exchanges with the Ambassador, agreeing to continue to work together and even intensify the work that the European Union and Korea can do to solve the problem, trying to deescalate the tensions, obviously continuing to implement the sanctions that the European Union has in place together with the rest of the international community, but also and mainly trying to open a political channel for negotiations. I believe that we will partner very well with President [of the Republic of Korea, Jae-in] Moon and the rest of the international community, but we have established a very strong and direct link so the European Union experience in this field - including from the negotiations we have led on the Iranian nuclear programme - are at the disposal of this process and can be further explored in the future. This is not linked to the agenda of the Development Ministers meeting but this is an extremely important step. First of all, the recognition of the role of the European Union on the global scene and also the specific competence and experience that the European Union has developed on the nuclear non-proliferation agenda that is obviously at the disposal of the entire international community in this particular moment. We also share the same view that any risk of military escalation in and around the Korean Peninsula should be avoided. This is priority number one in this moment. We have discussed this also with China, with Russia, with India recently. We will have a summit with China coming up soon so we will continue to remain extremely engaged but especially with a direct channel with Seoul on these issues. Apart from that, today we will have an important meeting with the Development Ministers to take a certain number of important decisions. The Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, will join us and I would like to highlight the fact that the European Union is, stays and will continue to stay, the first partner for the United Nations, the first humanitarian donor, the first provider of development aid and a strong supporter of the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda, the Agenda 2030, and in general terms – in more broader terms – of the UN system and the multilateral agenda that is sometimes put into question in these recent months. For the European Union, investing in development, investing in sustainable development, investing in the fight against climate change, in human rights, is an essential part of our security and foreign policy. We see this as an investment in our own security and prosperity – and this is what we share, I believe, with the entire UN system. This is why the European Union is and will continue to be a reliable, strong, committed partner for the entire international community on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, on the implementation of the Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and also on the peacekeeping and a conflict prevention agenda of the UN. I was very pleased to see not only Amina Mohammed joining us today, but also the UN Secretary General António Guterres addressing the European Parliament earlier this week exactly with the same message of recognition of the strength of the work of the European Union in this field.  What are the most important points of the Consensus on Development you will adopt today and how does it differ from the 2005 Consensus? It is a new way of looking at development that adjusts to the developments of the international agenda in the recent years. The world has changed, the situation in the world has changed and we are adapting our policies to that. So, we move from a traditional approach of donor recipient to a partnership approach in which we do things with our partners to cover all different set of fields. It is still mainly about poverty eradication and reduction but it is also covering many other fields that affect directly the living conditions of the people on the ground. Our main and privileged partner remains Africa and this fits very well with the debate we have had with the Foreign Ministers earlier this week where the President of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki [Mahamat] was present. We discussed exactly how we managed together to implement the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals], looking at the governance aspects, at human rights, at rule of law, at environment, at women's rights, at the place of youth in societies; so it is not only the traditional approach to development but it is a much broader concept that responds exactly to the philosophy of the SDGs and the agenda 2030, looking at the complexity of the world we are facing.

"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference with Sven Mikser, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia",12.05.2017,12.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/26042_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference with Sven Mikser, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia Tallinn, 12 May 2017  Check against delivery!  Thank you very much.  First of all, Sven [Mikser, Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs], it is really a pleasure for me to be back in Tallinn. This is my third visit in the recent years, and for sure not the last one in the next months. I will come back in June and then during the [Estonian] Presidency [of the Council] regularly, to run with you in full partnership our foreign, security and defence policy. I have had today very good, very fruitful meetings with the President, the Prime Minister, with the Minister of Defence, with the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and the Defence Committee in the Parliament, with you. We had discussions at length and excellent continuation of cooperation and preparation for the Presidency and I am going to open the Lennart Meri Conference [""Darkest before Dawn?: The war on trust and how to win it""] in a few minutes. Let me say, this is my second time at the conference, so I am particularly pleased for this opportunity I have and this honour. I would like to start by saying that Estonia is proceeding with the preparation for the Presidency in an excellent manner. It is going to be the first time the country holds this Presidency, having anticipated for six months this important event. More than an event actually - this important work in the service of the Union and the citizens of the Union and in particularly challenging times for both the internal life of the European Union but also for the international, regional situations we are facing. And I have to say, we feel in safe hands knowing that we move from the Maltese Presidency to the Estonian Presidency. Two countries that have a truly European approach – knowing very well that only being together as a Union we have the relevant size and impact that can protect our citizens in the world of today and have a clear and strong role in the globalised world we are living in. We discussed in particular with Sven [Mikser] the foreign policy agenda that will be characterising the six months of the Estonian Presidency. The Eastern Partnership Summit will be one of the highlights. It is extremely useful and important for us to prepare this work together, and together with each of the six partners that will be with us. Already in June we will have the Foreign Ministers of the Eastern partners joining us to prepare the Summit and during the beginning of the Estonian Presidency we will prepared the Summit together with Sven [Mikser]. I was particularly pleased he mentioned himself also the Africa-EU Summit we will have later in November. This is I think also symbolically extremely powerful – the fact that during the Presidency of a very Nordic country in the Union, one of the main political focuses of our foreign policy will be our partnership with Africa. On Monday, Sven [Mikser] will be with us at the Foreign Affairs Council where we will be hosting the President of the African Union Commission. If we want to work on security, counter-terrorism but also migration and economic development, we have to partner with our closest neighbour and our biggest neighbour - that I know from here is not Africa but it is in terms of continents  - and here the added value of Estonia especially in the field of digital competences will be particularly appreciated. And then,  we will have during the Presidency of Estonia a very substantial package on security and defence. I know that this is top priority here; this is top priority all over the European Union and this is why we are working now for the last year to use all the instruments the European Union has in the field of European defence, in strong cooperation with NATO. We will be implementing 42 practical projects of cooperation with NATO; Jens Stoltenberg and myself will report on that in June, just before we start the Estonian Presidency – so during these 6 months we will follow-up on these concrete actions in the field of maritime security, cyber threats, hybrid challenges. So, this will feature very high on the Estonian Presidency programme; and the same goes for the operational decisions we will take hopefully during the Estonian Presidency on the European defence. This can mean Permanent Structured Cooperation, this can mean the use of the Battlegroups, this can mean using all the instruments the European Union has to take care of the security of its citizens in cooperation with NATO – not in competition, never, but in a much more effective manner. Obviously, foreign policy in particular is what happens while you are planning things, so we will have also to deal together with any developments that will be arising during those 6 months and normally we always do have some developments going on. I can say that I am particularly glad that I will be able to count on good friends and wise friends here in Estonia, starting from Sven [Mikser] and all his colleagues, all the government, to guide the European Union through this challenging but also exciting next months. I will finish by saying we always – journalists as well – focus on the challenges, on the threats, on the crises. Let me tell you that seeing through the eyes of our partners in the world, the European Union in this moment is a point of reference. I know Europeans do not always perceive it this way; I believe Estonians do see the added value of being a Union and I think this is something on which you can help the other Europeans to realise what we have. And we have also a responsibility to be a point of reference for our partners in the world as a credible, reliable partner – corporative partner – that can play a very important role in the world of today.  Thank you.  Q and A Q. On sanctions against Russia. [details inaudible] FM: First of all, let me say that having adopted the decisions on the sanctions unanimously and having kept that unity for all these years – and continuing to keep this unity in the European Union for all these years – is not exactly seen as a failure on the Russian side. They were, I think, quite surprised, and these sanctions have an impact on the Russian economy. Let me also add that the Russian economy has problems by itself that derive from other elements but the sanctions – and this is an issue for the Russian authorities to tackle, but a serious issue. The sanctions for us are linked to, first of all, the annexation of Crimea that we consider and will consider in the future as illegal by international standards, and linked to the conflict in the east of Ukraine. For us sanctions are not a policy in itself – they are an instrument, one of the instruments we have to achieve the political objective we have which is the end of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, the full implementation of the Minsk agreements – it is only one component of our policy on the conflict in Ukraine and is also only one component of our relations with Russia. When it comes to our work on the conflict in Ukraine, in the east of Ukraine, we are doing other things that I would definitely not define a failure such as the strong support to the OSCE work in the east of Ukraine itself through the monitoring mission. The European Union is the strongest supporter of the mission and doing a lot of work on the ground – that is never enough, because in a conflict it is never enough what you manage to do on the ground – but both on humanitarian aid and on important issues like demining it is the European Union behind the positive things that manage to be done on the ground. The other element of our work on Ukraine is a very relevant one – that is the support to the reform agenda of the country. That is also a way of supporting the authorities in Kyiv to implement their side of the Minsk agreements.  Mainly the political side of the agreement, but we also say that the security side of the Minsk Agreement has also to be implemented and here we come back to the role of Russia and the influence it can exercise. The Minsk Agreement is an agreement that Russia has signed – its signature is something that should count for the Russian authorities themselves – and this is something we discuss with our Russian interlocutors. I was in Moscow myself a few weeks ago – this to say that beyond the sanctions we also have a dialogue open exactly to find ways in which we can help the implementation of the Minsk agreements, and our relations with Russia do not limit themselves to the disagreements and the different views we have on the conflict in Ukraine or the annexation of Crimea. We work constantly with Russia when it comes to some specific files where we see added value in cooperation. I think of counterterrorism dialogue or migration cooperation or the Nordic dimension and the Arctic – areas where the European Union and Russia and some of our member states still cooperate fruitfully together. Or I think of something that for me is very important – the fact that Russian students are the first beneficiaries of our Erasmus projects. Keeping our people together, exchanges of our people – intensified – is I believe a big investment we can do for the future of our relationship, because beyond leaderships there are people. Having said that, there are also fields of foreign policy for instance where we have a channel open. We constantly work together on issues like the crises in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan or DPRK. And there are files where the European Union and Russia see completely eye to eye – I think of the implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran or the conflict between Israel and Palestine. So it is a complex relation. It is a relation that as long as the situation in Ukraine will stay as it is will not go back to normal. But it is a relationship that also contemplates selective engagement on some issues where cooperation is needed.  Q. You just mentioned those challenges and what is ahead of us and one of the topics is EU and Turkey. Do you see any possibilities that there will be a new wave of immigrants towards EU? And the second part of the question is – as we heard today Slovakia and Hungary have not agreed to implement the quotas on refugees and do not accept them. So the question is: do we have a plan with Turkey? And the second part of the question is how do you react with those sayings from the Slovakian and Hungarian side? FM: First of all, let me say very clearly, our relation with Turkey goes well beyond the issue of the Syrian refugees. Turkey is a candidate country. Turkey is a big and relevant player in the region, having a key role when it comes to the war in Syria, when it comes to solving the Cypriot issue, when it comes to our economic or energy relations, when it comes to our relations with the people of Turkey – all of them. So I have always considered a limit to see our relations with Turkey only through the angle of how to manage the refugee crisis – that first of all, is a crisis for the refugees. We assume always the European perspective that we have lived through a refugee crisis – let me tell you that countries like Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world, hosts 700 000 refugees, with an economy that is not comparable to any of the economies of any of the European Union member states. And the same can go for most of the African or Asian countries and not to mention the fact that Jordan or Lebanon or Turkey themselves host millions of refugees. So I would like us to be rational on this and recognise that our support to Turkey in their efforts to host refugees in a decent manner – for instance giving education to the Syrian children – is an investment in our own future and it is an investment in the future of Syria and in the stability of the region, and that this is not the only issue we have on the table with Turkey. Actually, it is now not even the most relevant, as the major wave of migrants as you put it – and I would like us to make a clear distinction between the refugees and the migrants, these are two different things – in this moment is coming through Libya to Italy, so it is not a Turkish route. And on this the work we are doing with Africa will be essential, including the Africa Summit we will have during the Estonian Presidency. When it comes to – and by the way, I often say and I know this is not always popular in European Union – the management of the migration flows, including preventing irregular migration flows to the European Union, we also have to recognise the positive value of migration, including for some sectors of our economy. There are some sectors of the European economy that would not survive one single day if all the migrants were to disappear tomorrow from the European territory and I think we have to acknowledge this. Also being a land that has experienced migration or immigration in the last century and even in the last couple of decades. This is the same thing we should keep in mind talking about internal solidarity. One of the things that will come to the Presidency table not on the external angle – so it is not our file – will also be how we manage effective solidarity among Member States. This is not our direct institutional competence but I can tell you very openly we will need to share responsibility also when it comes to hosting and protecting refugees inside the European Union. If we continue to believe or to live in the illusion that countries of first arrival of refugees, be it Italy or Greece or tomorrow Estonia, you do not know where the next refugee flow will come from, you avoid seeing the reality  - which is that people do not come to one country or another, they come to Europe. And as a Union, we have to take responsibility and share responsibility and this will make things sustainable. There is no such a big number that would put in danger either the economies or the culture of any of our Member States. All of this is manageable and feasible if we do it together. It becomes a serious problem if it is only one Member State – even the bigger one – having to face something like this alone. The strength we have is that we are together and as in a family, if one member of the family is facing a difficulty, the others come and help. This is true for refugee crisis, this is true for economic support, this is true for all the other issues, we help each other. This is the basis of the European solidarity, this is the basis of being a Union and I believe we will have to find a practical, sustainable, rational manner to continue to help each or to start helping each other in some of the issues we are doing.  Q. New wave of refugees or migrants? [details inaudible] FM: It is a very different thing. It is different in legal terms and it is different in terms of routes from countries of origin and transit. The flow of migrants in these months is still very much relevant; the flow of Syrian refugees from Turkey is at the moment not so relevant. So, when you look at the complete number it is still a relevant one, but it is a different kind of wave and it is taking a different route. It is not Syrians, it is mainly Sub-Saharan Africans that are coming and it is not through Turkey but it is through Libya. It is a different route, it is a different kind of phenomenon that has to be tackled with different instruments and if you are asking me about the waves of migrants who are coming to Europe which means through Libya to Italy in this moment, I can tell you that the way in which we are handling this, thanks also to a very good work we have done with the Foreign Ministers of the all 28 Member States, is through a presence at sea – the European Union has a military mission at sea in the Mediterranean, at the same time dismantling the traffickers networks, having arrested more than 100 smugglers, seizing the boats that are used, saving lives – tens of thousands of people were saved but also training the Libyan coasts guards so that they can take care of the dismantling of the smuggling networks in the Libyan territorial waters. And we are doing two other things to prevent the losses of lives but also the flourishing of the trafficking of people: inside Libya, we are financing the presence of the International Organisation for Migration and the UNHCR so that they can have access to the detention centres where people are living in awful conditions, save these people, protect these people but also organising voluntary returns to the countries of origin; and we are also working with the countries of origin and transit, in particular Niger, where more than 80% of the flows transit. I can tell you one number that will strike you probably - in the last 9 months through our action with Niger, we moved from 76 000 migrants passing through Niger into Libya to 6 000. This is to say that it is through partnership, through cooperation with our African partners that we are managing the flows; we are dismantling the traffickers’ networks, we are saving lives and we are re-accompanying on a voluntary basis with the UN agencies, working in line with the international human rights standards so that people are protected and the irregular channels are closed. At the same time we also have to work on the regular channels of mobility. This is the work we are doing on the current wave we are facing.  Q. What do you think of China's Belt Road initiative as an effective option for international cooperation to solve the problems the West is facing? FM: I was in Beijing myself a couple of weeks ago, I had a chance to discuss this as well as our bilateral cooperation between the European Union and China with the Premier and all my interlocutors there and we are preparing in a very positive manner the next EU-China Summit that will take place in Brussels at the beginning of June. We see the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative as a positive initiative; Vice-President Katainen is at the OBOR Forum in these days. We believe this has to be developed first of all following international norms, second allowing the non-Chinese enterprises to also take part in the projects and in a good neighbourly spirit. We think connections and developing connections between Asia and Europe is definitely something positive that will benefit both Asia and Europe. It has to be done in the right manner; I think we can do it. And in general terms, I would like to add that my visit to Beijing was a real success and our cooperation has extremely solid basis. I think that China and the European Union recognised each other in this period of history of the world as two reliable global powers - we do not agree always on everything but we recognise each other's added value.

High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the EU-UN cooperation,09.05.2017,09.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/25815_en,,"Speech by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the EU-UN cooperation, delivered during annual briefing to UN Security Council New York City, Europe Day, 9 May 2017 Check against delivery! Muchas gracias señor Presidente, Es un gran honor para mi para hablar otra vez más en este Consejo de Seguridad. It is an honour to address the Security Council once again and to do this on a very symbolic day. Today - 9 May - is Europe day. The day when the European Union celebrates its being one, united. Sixty-seven years ago on this exact day, a French statesman – Robert Schuman – put forward a revolutionary idea for those times: that European States could share part of their sovereignty to prevent any future war in Europe. Two world wars, the most devastating conflicts in human history, started in Europe and spread to the whole planet after thousands of years of European conflicts. Our founding fathers and mothers imagined a renewed European continent – a continent that instead of exporting war would promote peace, democracy and human development within its borders and in the world. Seven years later, the Union took its first steps. And this year, we celebrate sixty years of our European Union. When Europeans simply realised that it was by far more convenient for all of us to cooperate instead of fighting each other. Choosing cooperation over confrontation, Europeans built in these sixty years the most successful peace project in history. So it's really not only an honour but also a pleasure to celebrate this historic day with you in the UN, in the Security Council. Let me say that some believed in these recent months that our sixtieth anniversary, our sixtieth birthday would also mark the beginning of the end of the EU, the beginning of the European Union’s decline. Indeed, our British friends have decided to leave us – which is sad for all of us - but life goes on and so does the European Union. Since the UK Referendum last year, we Europeans have recommitted to being the strong and united power that our citizens and our partners need and deserve. The European Union is and will continue to be the reliable, cooperative and indispensable partner the world needs. First and foremost, an indispensable power for our neighbours, for our region. Let me start with the Balkans, with our support, and in cooperation with the United Nations, our friends there have taken impressive steps forward, in the most difficult and turbulent circumstances sometimes – steps forward towards peace andregional cooperation, towards economic growth, and towards the European Union. Because one thing is clear, the future of our Union will not be at twenty-seven. We will have new members joining the Unionin the future, starting from the Balkans. Au delà de notre continent, nous sommes lepartenaire indispensable d'un monde plus coopératif, plus multilatéral et plus pacifique. Un partenaire indispensable des Nations Unies et de tous ceux qui considère le multilatéralisme la clé d'un ordre mondial qui fonctionne. En célébrant notre soixantième anniversaire, le Secrétaire Général a dit ""en ces temps de division mondiale, la vision portée par l'Union européenne de coopération et d'intégration est plus importante que jamais"". I would like to begin from here, from our vision. It is what we like to call the European way – the European way to peace and security, the European way to growth and sustainable development, the European way to international relations. This European way is also the United Nations’ way. And this explains why all our actions, all our initiatives are always taken in full coordination and partnership with the United Nations. We believe in the UN because we believe in the same principles, in the same values, and our communities are built upon the same fundamental ideals. 1. SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT First of all, we believe that security is not only about military might. It is about finding common ground,cooperation over confrontation, diplomacy. It is about human development and economic growth. It is about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. When Antonio Guterres highlights the importance of conflict prevention and mediation, his words resonate with the European way to security, and in particular with the European Union’s Global Strategy and our integrated approach to conflict and crises. When you read the Security Council’s Resolutions on “Women, Peace and Security”, or “Youth, Peace and Security”, the rationale is the same as in our own work to strengthen resilience inside and around Europe. We are turning these concepts into practice each and every day as Europeans. When a peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC was announced, the European Union was there,immediately building a path from peace to full reconciliation. We have some European experience in this direction. When President Juan Manuel Santos came to Europe to receive the Nobel Peace Prize - he came to us to the European Union in Brussels straight from Oslo and Stockholm - we announced together, we signed a European Trust Fund that is helping today Colombia reap the economic dividends of peace. I understand that coming back from a field trip to Colombia, you have been able to witness our work yourselves. Another example. Just over a month ago, in Brussels, we convened together with Antonio Guterres, the international Conference on the future of Syria and the region. • Our primary goal was and still is to address the urgency – the dramatic humanitarian situation faced by Syrians both inside and outside of the country, and to support their hosting communities. • But in the difficult hours after the chemical attack in Idlib’sprovince, we also worked together with the UN and with most of you to strengthen the world’s support to the UN-led negotiations in Geneva, and to a political solution. Let me say that I talked yesterday to Staffan de Mistura, as I often do to coordinate the UN and EU work on Syria, and we are extremely supportive of his decision to resume the intra-Syrian talks as of next week. The European Union is and will continue to be actively, strongly, engaged and committed in accompanying the UN-ledpolitical process with all our means and determination. • As we did in the Brussels Conference, there we prepared also the ground for the international community to start looking into the post-war reconstruction of Syria. Itis clear for us that the reconstruction will work only when a political transition is under way and the political agreement is achieved in Geneva. But we have lost the peace too many times not to have learned the lesson and we believe that when the war is over, we will need collectively to invest in reconciliation, stabilisation and reconstruction of the country. This will be a powerful leverage and a dividend of peace for all the Syrians and for the region at large. On each of these strands of work, the international community will have to preserve on Syria a fragile unity. You know this better than anyone else. And to this end the European Union is determined to continue mobilising all its resources in support of the UN work to put an end to this war. This is the European way – addressing the urgency and the long term, the humanitarian, the security and the diplomatic needs at the same time. The same approach, moving from one continent to another, shaped the Brussels Conference for the Central African Republic – which we organised together with the United Nations, and I chaired with President Faustin-Archange Touadera. We managed to mobilise more than 2 billion euros in support of the government’s priorities. Now it is time to implement these pledges. By the way, the European Union is always an international player that implements all its pledges. The European Union is not only the largest donor: we are also present there on the ground with a military training mission, working in close cooperation with the UN forces, as we do everywhere we have presence. The European Union is increasingly active also as a security provider worldwide. Our Member States contribute to almost 40 per cent of the UN budget for peacekeeping operations: collectively, we are the largest contributor. In addition to that, the European Union’s fifteen military and civilian operations worldwide work in constant cooperation with the United Nations. Let me just mention Operation Sophia off the coast of Libya, which has been endorsed twice by this Security Council with a certain degree of unity forwhich I would like to thank you. The tasks of our EU military operation, today, include not only to dismantle the networks of smugglers off the coast of Libya, but we also completed the training of the first group of Libyan coastguards – I was honoured to hand over the diplomas myself in quite a moving ceremony on the flagship of the Operation Sophia in Malta - and we also delivered to them the first motorboats so that the security of the territorial waters can be in their hands. And, as mandated by the Security Council, Operation Sophia is also enforcing the arms embargo, and only last week, weseized a shipping of weapons and ammunitions. Your endorsement of our Operation is a great sign of the trust that this institution puts in the men and women serving under the European flag. Doing it the European way in the UN context. We take this responsibility very seriously. Last year, just days after my briefing to the Security Council, I presented a Global Strategy for our foreign and security policy. The Strategy foresees greater European cooperation on security and defence. And in one year, actually less than one year, nine, ten months, we have taken more steps towards a European Union of security and defence than in the previous sixty years. More cooperation in European defence means a more efficient spending, better capabilities, more security for our citizens and more security for the world. But it also means that we are becoming an even more reliable partner for our neighbours and friends, starting with the United Nations, NATO, and many regional organisations with which we partner on security issues. Yet, as I said from the outset, we consider our military capabilities as only one element in our security strategy. To prevent a conflict, you also need good development policies and strong State institutions. Peace is never sustainable without decent infrastructure, good health care or education, without participation, without democracy. This is what we call resilience, and the United Nations remain for us a fundamental partner in this kind of work. For this reason, the European Union’s voluntary contributions to the UN funds and agencies amount to half of their total budget. This means we proudly and smartly invest in them as much as the rest of the world combined because we believe that it's our interest to do so: In the World Food Program to prevent a humanitarian crisis; in UNICEF to help children in a war-torn country go to school and prevent radicalisation; in the UNHCR and UNRWAfor millions of displaced people – these are all contributions to our common security. So let me be very clear, and speak directly to our American friends. It is essential for us that we all keep investing in these UN Agencies. They are as important to global peace and security as defence spending – and sometimes even more. And we, Europeans, consider this support to the UN system as a crucial investment in our own security. Take the terrible famine that has hit the Horn of Africa. It has the potential to make a fragile situation even worse and turn into a security situation. This also serves as a powerful reminder that climate change is real, and is already impacting on our security environment. Everything is linked. So we continue to expect that the United States will find a way to remain committed to the Paris Agreement. I know that there is a debate ongoing and we respect it very much. But 195 countries have signed the deal on climate change, and there will be 195 different paths to meeting the Paris goals and honouring the agreement. I am sure there is room for the US Administration to find its own path, being part of what the world has agreed together and finding its own way to do so. 2. WIN-WIN SOLUTIONS The Paris Agreement shows the right approach to the challenges of our era. The international community managed to get together and seek common solutions beyond the traditional divides. Over the last few years, we already managed to overcome these divides with the Sustainable Development Goals. That was a key achievement for us. This month, actually next week, the European Council will adopt the new Consensus on development, which brings Agenda 2030 at the core of our development policies, both at European and national level. It will be a pleasure for me to welcome Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed that day in Brussels. I believe the greatest divide in today’s world is between those who believe that international politics are a zero-sum game, and those who work to buildwin-win solutions and common ground. The European way is a constant search for win-win solutions. And the essence of the United Nations is to represent a space where compromise can always prevail over confrontation. This is why I say that the European way is the UN way. This search for win-win solutions is another field where the European way and the UN way convergetotally. We saw it last year at the UN Summit for refugees and migrants. Instead of focusing on what divides us – the North and the South, the developing and the developed – we looked for cooperative solutions, for partnerships, what we call thecompacts. Since then, the European Union has worked on partnerships with five African countries – including Ethiopia and Senegal, who sit in the Security Council today and can bear witness. This win-win solutions search cannot be imposed by one side on the other: our approach is that we can only be agreed together on what is good for both, which is why we are defining different priorities for our cooperation with each of our partners. This cooperative approach is already producing some concrete results, and we believe this work can feed into the discussion towards a Global Compact for refugees and migrants in the UN framework. Let me add that our cooperation with UN Agencies on migration is constant and extremely positive. I would like to mention in particular the situation in Libya, which as you know is very close to the European heart. In Libya, we see the conditions of migrants stranded in the country are dramatic. For this reason, we are funding a 90-million-euro support package for Libya, in support of the work of the IOM, the UNHCR and UNDP inside the country. We think this is the way. Confrontational approaches lead nowhere. Between win-win and lose-lose, the European Union has picked sides. We stand always on the side of dialogue and partnership. Where others might see conflict, we look for co-operation. In times of global disorder, when instability spreads from one side of the world to the other, building win-win solutions is difficult but for us it is a must. There is no sustainable alternative to that. This is certainly true on counter-terrorism: the attacks in Europe over the last year tell us that cross border cooperation is of the utmost importance. So we support Antonio Guterres’ proposal to establish aUN Office on Counter-Terrorism, to be headed by an Under-Secretary-General: his proposal can enhance coordination and effectiveness in our work, to the benefit of all. Security today is truly a global issue. Let us look at an obvious example that this Council was dealing with recently several times in a very important manner: the situation in the Korean Peninsula. Amilitary escalation with North Korea would lead to devastating consequences. We believe we all have an interest to avoid confrontation, and to push for DPRK to re-engage with the international community. I'm following very closely in these hours the results of elections in the Republic of Korea to see if that will open new avenues of engagement. 3. RULES-BASED GLOBAL ORDER This leads me to a third point before I conclude,another essential feature of the European way. We believe in a global order based on rules. Rules that are agreed together, and respected by all – as it should be the case for non-proliferation. In our chaotic era, rules are too often perceived, globally but also in our own countries, as a constraint for some, more than a guarantee for all. But more power-politics is the perfect recipe for further destabilisation. International rules for us are not a threat, but a protection to every nation’s autonomy. These rules include territorial integrity and theinviolability of borders. And for this reason, we do not and will not recognise Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. And we will continue to work to bring the conflict in eastern Ukraine to an end, with the fullimplementation of the Minsk agreements. When any such violations occur, we are all less secure. When accountability is not guaranteed, the credibility of the entire international system comes under question. So we have repeated time and again, after the chemical attack in Syria for instance, that accountability for those crimes must be guaranteed – and we fully support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its important and delicate work. And we believe that this is the correct place, the correct forum, whereaccountability should be guaranteed. 4. A CALL FOR MULTILATERALISM Quand nous parlons de multilatéralisme, il ne s'agit pas d'une profession de foi rhétorique. It s'agit de prendre ces règles au sérieux, d'investir dans les institutions multilatérales et de voir dans les Nations Unies le cadre globale dans lequel s'inscrivent nos actions. Ce n'est pas une posture idéologique, mais un choix calculé et pragmatique tout à la fois. Aucune puissance mondiale n'est assez forte pour mettre seule un terme aux crises de notre temps. Chaque crise concerne trop d'acteurs et implique trop d'enjeux. Toute contribution est bienvenue et personne ne peut contribuer dans le vide. If you take the conflict between Israel and Palestine.Last year we revived the Middle East Quartet, and reached an unprecedented consensus on the risks for the two-state solution and on practical recommendations. We must preserve and enlarge that unity, for instance through cooperation between the European Union and the Arab League, and between the Quartet and Arab States. And I see Egypt sitting here as being one of the key players in this respect. I was honoured to discuss these perspectives at the Summit of the League of Arab States in Jordan last month. And of course we need the Israelis and the Palestinians first of all to directly negotiate, with the accompanying efforts of the international community, starting with the United States, the European Union, Russia, the UN, and all those who believe that peace needs the direct involvement of the two parties but also our contribution to help them reach a solution. Different initiatives can bring important contributions to a peace process. In some situations, we need to be imaginative and look for new channels, when the traditional formats seem to fail. This seems to be the case for Venezuela, where it is vital to stop the escalation and establish a new form of mediation that can be agreed by all sides. We stand ready to help in any useful way with respect and in support of any useful initiative that can be put into place. The European Union never looks for just a photo-opportunity. That is not the interest we have. Between a theatrical but empty statement, and a silent but effective mediation, we will always choose the latter. The real impact matters more than the headlines to us. In all cases, coordination and complementarity arethe key. And the best way to guarantee coordination is by working together with the United Nations. Peace for Syria can only come from negotiations among the Syrian parties, in Geneva – and I would like to thank once again Staffan de Mistura for his incredible work and leadership. Peace in Yemen: the European Union is sponsoring track-two and peacebuilding initiatives – but this needs to feed into a UN process. And in Libya, a window of opportunity has just opened. We support enormously and we believe that the Libyans must seize this moment, and we are fully behind the UN efforts to bring a political solution to the crisis. Whatever the format, whatever the initiative, we believe that the United Nations must be the centre of gravity of all peacebuilding efforts in an effective manner. Only the UN can guarantee the coherence of the process and the strength of the outcome and of the implementation. The nuclear deal with Iran shows the way forward to us, the Europeans. It set a milestone for non-proliferation, making everyone more secure – in the region, in Europe, and in the world. World powers negotiated the deal, but the agreement was immediately ratified by the Security Council and the deal now belongs to the entire international community – not only to us who were in that room in Vienna. And the IAEA has certified five times its implementation. This is the European way. Enforcing and strengthening the rules of non-proliferation we brought to an end twelve years of confrontation through peaceful dialogue. It is the European way, and it is the United Nations’ way. A successful deal makes the whole system more credible, because it shows we can collectively deliver on our citizens’ needs. The best way to preserve and reinforce this credibility, is by making the UN system more effective. So we stand fully behind the Secretary-General's reform agenda, on the Peace and Security pillar, the SDG's implementation, and the UN management reform. This agenda has the potential to make the whole UN family less fragmented, more united and coherent. The European Union cares about the United Nations. It's a precious tool. In sixty years of history, we have become a superpower for peace in the European Union, a superpower for peace but alsofor security and democracy. We are accompanying reconciliation processes at all corners of the world, from Afghanistan to Myanmar. We are supporting our Eastern partners strengthen their economies and their institutions, their resilience – and in just a few days we will announce a visa liberalisation agreement with our Ukrainian friends. We are finding new ways to support Africa’s growth, together with African governments and with the African Union, and also with the private sector and the civil society of the continent. The European Union has become in these years, in these decades, in these sixty years of our history, not only the most successful peace project in the world, but also an indispensable partner to move beyond the current disorder, and to try to build together a more cooperative world order. So we will always return to this centre of gravity, this pivot of a rules-based international system. Because the European way is the UN way. The European vision is the United Nations’ vision. And whoever wants to invest in this system, will find in the European Union a partner and a friend, a reliable, constructive, cooperative partner. Thank you very much. New York"
Statement by HRVP Mogherini at the United Nations Security Council: Cooperation between the UN and the EU,09.05.2017,09.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/36886_en,,"Statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, at the United Nations Security Council: Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations in maintaining international peace and security – European Union. Muchas gracias señor Presidente, Es un gran honor para mí para hablar otra vez más en este Consejo de Seguridad. It is an honour to address the Security Council once again and to do this on a very symbolic day. Today, the 9 th of May, is Europe day. The day when the European Union celebrates its being one, united. Sixty-seven years ago on this exact day, a French statesman – Robert Schuman – put forward a revolutionary idea for those times: that European States could share part of their sovereignty to prevent any future war in Europe. Two world wars, the most devastating conflicts in human history, started in Europe and spread to the whole planet after thousands of years of European conflicts. Our founding fathers and mothers imagined a renewed European continent – a continent that instead of exporting war would promote peace, democracy and human development within its borders and in the world. Seven years later, the Union took its first steps. And this year, we celebrate sixty years of our European Union. When Europeans simply realised that it was by far more convenient for all of us to cooperate instead of fighting each other. Choosing cooperation over confrontation, Europeans built in these sixty years the most successful peace project in history. So it’s really not only an honour but also a pleasure to celebrate this historic day with you in the UN, in the Security Council. Let me say that some believed in these recent months that our sixtieth anniversary, our sixtieth birthday would also mark the beginning of the end of the EU, the beginning of the European Union’s decline. Indeed, our British friends have decided to leave us – which is sad for all of us – but life goes on and so does the European Union. Since the UK Referendum last year,  we Europeans have recommitted to being the strong and united power that our citizens and our partners need and deserve. The European Union is and will continue to be the reliable,  cooperative and indispensable partner the world needs. First and foremost, an indispensable power for our neighbours, for our region. Let me start with the Balkans, with our support, and in cooperation with the United Nations, our friends there have taken impressive steps forward, in the most difficult and turbulent circumstances sometimes – steps forward towards peace and regional cooperation, towards economic growth, and towards the European Union. Because one thing is clear, the future of our Union will not be at twenty-seven. We will have new members joining the Union in the future, starting from the Balkans. Au-delà de notre continent, nous sommes le partenaire indispensable d’un monde plus coopératif, plus multilatéral et plus pacifique. Un partenaire indispensable des Nations Unies et de tous ceux qui considère le multilatéralisme la clé d’un ordre mondial qui fonctionne. En célébrant notre soixantième anniversaire, le Secrétaire Général a dit “en ces temps de division mondiale, la vision portée par l’Union européenne de coopération et d’intégration est plus importante que jamais”. I would like to begin from here, from our vision. It is what we like to call the European way – the European way to peace and security, the European way to growth and sustainable development, the European way to international relations. This European way is also the United Nations’ way. And this explains why all our actions, all our initiatives are always taken in full coordination and partnership with the United Nations. We believe in the UN because we believe in the same principles, in the same values, and our communities are built upon the same fundamental ideals. First of all, we believe that security is not only about military might. It is about finding common ground, cooperation over confrontation, diplomacy. It is about human development and economic growth. It is about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. When António Guterres highlights the importance of conflict prevention and mediation, his words resonate with the European way to security, and in particular with the European Union’s Global Strategy and our integrated approach to conflict and crises. When you read the Security Council’s Resolutions on “Women, Peace and Security”, or “Youth, Peace and Security”, the rationale is the same as in our own work to strengthen resilience inside and around Europe. We are turning these concepts into practice each and every day as Europeans. When a peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC was announced, the European Union was there, immediately building a path from peace to full reconciliation. We have some European experience in this direction. When President Juan Manuel Santos came to Europe to receive the Nobel Peace Prize – he came to us to the European Union in Brussels straight from Oslo and Stockholm – we announced together, we signed a European Trust Fund that is helping today Colombia reap the economic dividends of peace. I understand that coming back from a field trip to Colombia, you have been able to witness our work yourselves. Another example. Just over a month ago, in Brussels, we convened together with António Guterres, the international Conference on the future of Syria and the region. On each of these strands of work, the international community will have to preserve on Syria a fragile unity. You know this better than anyone else. And to this end the European Union is determined to continue mobilising all its resources in support of the UN work to put an end to this war. This is the European way – addressing the urgency and the long term, the humanitarian, the security and the diplomatic needs at the same time. The same approach, moving from one continent to another, shaped the Brussels Conference for the Central African Republic – which we organised together with the United Nations, and I chaired with President Faustin-Archange Touadera. We managed to mobilise more than 2 billion euros in support of the government’s priorities. Now it is time to implement these pledges. By the way, the European Union is always an international player that implements all its pledges. The European Union is not only the largest donor: we are also present there on the ground with a military training mission, working in close cooperation with the UN forces, as we do everywhere we have presence. The European Union is increasingly active also as a security provider worldwide. Our Member States contribute to almost 40 per cent of the UN budget for peacekeeping operations: collectively, we are the largest contributor. In addition to that, the European Union’s fifteen military and civilian operations worldwide work in constant cooperation with the United Nations. Let me just mention Operation Sophia off the coast of Libya, which has been endorsed twice by this Security Council with a certain degree of unity for which I would like to thank you.

And in one year, actually less than one year, nine, ten months, we have taken more steps towards a European Union of security and defence than in the previous sixty years. More cooperation in European defence means a more efficient spending, better capabilities, more security for our citizens and more security for the world. But it also means that we are becoming an even more reliable partner for our neighbours and friends, starting with the United Nations, NATO, and many regional organisations with which we partner on security issues. Yet, as I said from the outset, we consider our military capabilities as only one element in our security strategy.

But 195 countries have signed the deal on climate change, and there will be 195 different paths to meeting the Paris goals and honouring the agreement. I am sure there is room for the US Administration to find its own path, being part of what the world has agreed together and finding its own way to do so.

It will be a pleasure for me to welcome Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed that day in Brussels. I believe the greatest divide in today’s world is between those who believe that international politics are a zero-sum game, and those who work to build win-win solutions and common ground. The European way is a constant search for win-win solutions. And the essence of the United Nations is to represent a space where compromise can always prevail over confrontation. This is why I say that the European way is the UN way. This search for win-win solutions is another field where the European way and the UN way converge totally.

"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press point with Børge Brende, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway ahead of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC)",04.05.2017,04.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/25572_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press point with Børge Brende, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway ahead of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC)  Check against delivery!  I am very glad to host today again together with Foreign Minister [Børge] Brende of Norway the annual meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, to take stock as we do regularly of the Palestinian state-building process and to discuss ways to improve and sustain the Palestinian economy. This is the focus of our meeting today. We have 28 delegations - including the United Nations, United States, Russia and key countries in the Middle East participating in this important annual meeting. It is a collective effort for us and also the only forum where both Israeli and Palestinian ministers meet together with international partners. As such, it is a very relevant forum focused on the improvement and the support to the Palestinian economy and state-building but also providing us with good opportunities for meetings at the margins, as we just had together with minister Brende and some of the participants today. The fact that we are hosting this meeting also underlines once again that the Middle East and the process leading to peace between Israel and Palestine remains a top priority for the European Union. The focus of our work more broadly is on how to create the conditions on the ground for a successful resumption of negotiations. Because this is our ultimate objective, an objective we share with our friends in the international community and with the parties, that the parties can re-start negotiations on a two-state solution, which in our view is the only viable way to achieve just and lasting peace. The path to a political solution remains very clear to us: Israelis and Palestinians need to reverse the negative trends, stop settlements expansion, effectively fight incitement to violence, resolve the Palestinian divisions and urgently improve the critical humanitarian and security situation in Gaza. Our engagement is based on the assumption that our work as donors - and as you know the European Union is the first donor - contributes to the perspective of the two states, to the political solution. The logic of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee has always been that progress on the ground and economic development cannot and should not substitute political progress, but also that political progress is very hard to achieve without a positive environment on the ground. And so by working on the positive steps on the ground we are also trying to create a positive environment for the political process to restart. It is no secret that the situation on the ground today is not good. The gaps are wide, not easy to bridge. There is a complexity of the conflict that everybody understands, but there are also new opportunities. I am particularly encouraged by the meeting that took place yesterday in the White House between [Palestinian] President [Mahmoud] Abbas and President [of the United States, Donald] Trump. The European Union is working very closely with the United States. We discussed this today also bilaterally with Jason Greenblatt [U.S Special Representative for International Negotiations] who is here for the United States, and with all our international partners, particularly with the Quartet, with Norway, with the region, and our partners in the region, in particular with our Arab friends on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative as we discussed, and I personally discussed last month at the Summit of the League of Arab States in Jordan. We are trying to mobilise all our resources, not only economic but also political resources, in a combined and coordinated effort to help make renewed peace efforts successful.  Q&A  Q. Hamas announced two days before that they are accepting a Palestinian State in the borders of 4 June 1967. I would like to have your comment and also of the minister. And what is the level of ambition of this meeting regarding the budget difficulties and the financial aspect?  FM : On the document that Hamas has made public a few days ago that – if I understand correctly – complements and does not substitute previous positions, we have seen some elements that are interesting ones. We will see what comes next in terms of actual political decisions. We have always insisted a lot, not only as the European Union but also with our partners in the Quartet, on the Palestinian unity and the need to make sure that all Palestinian people, be it in Gaza or in the West Bank, live decent lives and benefit from a better standard of living. So we will see what kind of political practical consequences some of the elements that are in this paper will bring.  In terms maybe of the ambition of today's meeting on financing, I might leave this more to my Norwegian friend that chairs the committee. But I would like to stress one point that he also very rightly made: there is a strong commitment from the European Union and Norway, so from a European side, as it has always been the case and will continue to be the case. But the donors' role or the donors' efforts alone will not solve the crisis, would not solve alone the issue. And the real thing is to feed into a political process that has to restart on the basis of negotiations, direct negotiations between the two parties and in the framework of the two-state solution. And this is also why we have used this day - the convening power that Norway and the European Union can exercise together – to have a conversation  bilaterally, but also together with some of the key actors that are present today not only on the financial implications and the donors' work but also on the political horizon, especially in these days when we might see some developments coming.

Preparatory Committee for the 2020 NPT Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) - EU Statement on Cluster Issues,02.05.2017,02.05.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/26119_en,,"Preparatory Committee for the 2020 NPT Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) - EU Statement on Cluster Issues Vienna, 2-12 May 2017 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. Mr. Chairman, For the European Union, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with Article VI of the NPT and an important element in the future development of nuclear energy applications for peaceful purposes. At the start of this important review cycle, our priority is to strengthen the implementation of the NPT in order to uphold and preserve its role as a key multilateral instrument for reinforcing international peace, security and stability and to promote its universalisation. We call upon States that have not yet done so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear weapon States. We reiterate the EU's strong and resolute support to all three pillars of the Treaty which are equally important and mutually reinforcing and can contribute to a safer world. We call on all State Parties to implement all the obligations and commitments assumed under the NPT or undertaken during previous Review Conferences. The EU will continue to promote comprehensive, balanced and full implementation of the 2010 Action Plan designed to strengthen the three pillars of the Treaty. The concrete, equally important and mutually reinforcing steps on nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy contained in the 2010 Action Plan remain valid and will contribute to the objective of achieving a world without nuclear weapons. It is of utmost importance that all parties contribute to improving the strategic context for arms control and disarmament. The EU continues to contribute actively to global efforts to seek a safer world for all and to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals of the NPT, in a way that promotes international stability, and based on the principle of undiminished security for all. The EU notes the severe consequences associated with nuclear weapons use and emphasises that all States share the responsibility to prevent such an occurrence from happening. EU Member States are undertaking initiatives in multilateral fora to enhance nuclear disarmament and may elaborate on these initiatives in their national statements. EU Member States remain committed to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, in accordance with Article VI of the NPT. The EU recalls that all NPT State Parties are committed to pursuing policies that are fully compatible with the Treaty and the objective of achieving a world without nuclear weapons. We stress the need for concrete progress towards the full implementation of Article VI of the NPT, especially through an overall reduction in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, taking into account the special responsibility of the States that possess the largest nuclear arsenals. The entry into force of the new START agreement in 2011 between the United States and the Russian Federation was a significant step and welcomed by the EU. The EU encourages the United States and the Russian Federation to seek further reductions to their arsenals, including strategic and non-strategic, deployed and non-deployed nuclear weapons and reduce the operational readiness of their nuclear weapon systems to the minimum level necessary. The EU encourages the United States and the Russian Federation to include non-strategic nuclear weapons into arms control and nuclear disarmament processes and pursue further discussions on confidence-building, transparency, verification activities and reporting. We welcome the increased transparency shown by some nuclear weapon States, including by two EU Member States, on the nuclear weapons they possess, and call on others to do likewise. We call on all States concerned to take appropriate practical measures in order to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war. We must continue to work for the resolution of the problems of regional instability and insecurity and of the conflict situations which are often at the root of armament programmes. Bearing in mind the current severe security environment, we stress the need to advance the general arms control and disarmament processes and call for further progress on all aspects of disarmament to enhance global security. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is a landmark arms control agreement that has eliminated an entire class of weapons, including some 3000 nuclear and conventional ballistic missiles. It is vital for Europe’s and other regions' security and stability and a tangible contribution by the United States, the Russian Federation and other States Parties to the fulfilment of their obligations under Article VI of the NPT. The EU calls on all Parties to preserve the INF Treaty and to ensure its full and verifiable compliance. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is of crucial importance to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and its entry into force and universalisation remain top priorities for the EU. All EU Member States have ratified the CTBT and are abiding by its obligations. We reiterate our call on all States that have not yet done so, in particular those listed in Annex 2, to sign and ratify the Treaty in order to allow its early entry into force. In the meantime, the EU calls on all States, in particular the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), to abide by a moratorium on nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosion, and to refrain from any action that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty. The EU will continue to provide strong diplomatic and financial support to the Treaty, including enhancing the verification capabilities of the International Monitoring System. The EU has hosted a dedicated side-event during this Preparatory Committee session to highlight the importance of the CTBT. We welcome the reaffirmation of the importance of the CTBT through UN Security Council Resolution 2310. The EU remains united and committed to treaty-based nuclear disarmament and arms control and stresses the need to renew multilateral efforts and revitalize multilateral negotiating bodies. We reiterate the necessity, more than ever, to overcome the longstanding deadlock of the Conference on Disarmament and recall our commitment to its enlargement. We continue to call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of the negotiation in the Conference on Disarmament of a Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (FMCT), on the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein. We welcome the establishment of the High Level Expert Preparatory Group, whose mandate is to make recommendations on substantial elements for a future Treaty, without prejudice to national positions in future negotiations. In the meantime, we call on all States possessing nuclear weapons that have not yet done so to declare and uphold an immediate moratorium on their production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. We welcome the action by some nuclear weapon States, in particular by the two EU Member States, which have declared relevant moratoria and dismantled or converted such facilities and call on others to follow suit. Through its continued financial support to the G7 Global Partnership and to the International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC), the EU has significantly contributed to international efforts to destroy and eliminate stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and fissile material, and to re-direct scientific and technical expertise for peaceful purposes. The EU and its Member States supported the 2016 General Assembly Resolution on Nuclear Disarmament Verification and we welcome the establishment of the Group of Governmental Experts to consider the role of verification in advancing nuclear disarmament. While verification is not an aim in itself, further development of the multilateral nuclear verification capabilities will be required for the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons. Promotion of gender equality, gender consciousness and empowerment of women remains another key priority for the EU, including in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. The EU is committed to the full implementation of Resolution 1325 and all other relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council aimed at advancing the women, peace and security agenda. The EU recognizes the legitimate interest of non-nuclear weapon States in receiving unequivocal security assurances from nuclear weapon States as part of a binding and agreed security arrangement. The EU calls on all nuclear weapon States to reaffirm existing security assurances noted by UN Security Council Resolution 984 (1995) and recalled in UN Security Council Resolution 1887 (2009) and Resolution 2310 (2016). The EU recalls that Russia has specifically committed to refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or sovereignty of Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 on security assurances, in connection with Ukraine's accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon State. We acknowledge the importance of nuclear weapon free zones for peace and security, on the basis of arrangements freely entered into between all the States of the region concerned. The EU recognizes that treaty-based security assurances are available to nuclear weapon free zones and encourages nuclear weapon States to sign and ratify the relevant protocols to the Treaties establishing nuclear weapon free zones drawn up following the requisite consultations. The proliferation of missiles with potential to deliver weapons of mass destruction constitutes a severe threat to international peace and security as underlined in a number of UN Security Council Resolutions. We are gravely concerned over the ongoing development of ballistic missile programmes, especially in the DPRK. In addition to support for other multilateral instruments, such as the Hague Code of Conduct, the EU strongly supports the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) which is celebrating its 30 th anniversary this year and plays a crucial role in tackling the proliferation of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and UAV technologies. We continue to advocate the full membership of all 28 EU Member States in the international export control regimes. We wish to highlight the importance of the disarmament and non-proliferation education and the useful role played by the EU Non-Proliferation Consortium, the European network of independent think tanks. The annual EU Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Conference has become an important forum to encourage global dialogue on all relevant issues. Mr. Chairman, 17. The EU and its Member States agree on the importance of upholding and strengthening the authority and integrity of the NPT, which has contributed to international peace, security and stability for more than 40 years. We are determined to work towards a successful outcome of the 2020 NPT Review Conference. Thank you, Mr. Chairman Vienna"
Remarks by High-Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta George Vella,28.04.2017,28.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/25302_en,,"Remarks by High-Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta George Vella Valletta, 28 April 2017 Check against delivery!  Thank you very much George [Vella, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta]. I would like to start by thanking you personally for the dedication and the professionalism with which you have prepared this meeting and you are running the presidency; and all your team, really extremely dedicated. Indeed I am now enjoying my third day in Malta, leaving tomorrow morning , for what I considered to be a very useful, fruitful, constructive and important sequence, yesterday the informal meeting of the Defence Ministers who took some important orientations and today, our exchanges were particularly important.  Thank you for leaving the content to me. On Turkey in particular, we had a long and frank, open exchange with the Member States on the future of our relations with Turkey. I will summarise some common points, five points if I am not wrong on which we have common orientations. You know that informal ministerial meetings are not for taking formal decisions or for adopting conclusions but we shared a common ground that I will report now to you.  First, we respect and recognise the sovereign right of any country, including Turkey obviously, to decide its governance system as Turkey has done through the referendum on the constitutional amendments. So, we respect the result of the referendum even if we acknowledge that there are appeals ongoing or foreseen. We expect that the implementation of the constitutional amendments will be done first of all following the Venice Commission recommendations and the observation of the OSCE-ODIHR [Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights], especially when the final report of the referendum observation mission will come out. And second, we expect its implementation seeking the highest degree of national unity and inclusiveness, given especially the very divided picture of the country, as the result of the referendum has shown, with the maximum attention of the Turkish authorities side to respect all political positions, including those who supported the camp that has lost the referendum, and seeking for the maximum degree of unity within the Turkish society and the political spectrum.  Second point, the European Union has a clear interest in a stable, secure, economically successful and democratic Turkey which is - as George was saying - a relevant partner, a relevant player on many different issues. Our intention is not and will never be of doing anything that could damage Turkey or the Turkish people. On the contrary, we are seeking cooperation - constructive cooperation on many different things - for the benefits of our citizens respectively: all Turkish citizens, all European Union citizens.  The Turkish people, the Turkish citizens, all of them, are at the centre of our dialogue and cooperation; we will continue to support strongly the civil society in the country. And people from Turkey, the citizens for Turkey, are at the centre of our talks and work also when it comes to negotiations on accession process.  Then, the accession process continues, it is not suspended, nor ended but as you might know, we are currently not working on opening any new negotiation chapter. And second, the criteria for accession negotiations are extremely clear, are very well known to Turkey. If Turkey is interested in accession negotiations - as Foreign Minister [Mevlüt] Çavuşoğlu told us today and I understand President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan expressed the same views in recent hours - if Turkey is interested in accession negotiations, it knows very well what it implies, especially in the field of human rights, rule of law, democracy, fundamental freedoms including media freedom, obviously the death penalty, and the respect of international law and the principle of good neighbourly relations. These are core principles to which Turkey is called as a candidate country to the European Union but also as a member of the Council of Europe. We are determined as the European Union, together with all the Member States, to work very closely with the Council of Europe i in the follow-up of the process.  We will discuss with our Turkish interlocutors the way forward, from our side in a very frank, open, constructive, serious, but serene manner. We have started today; I will have a proper – let's say full-fledged - bilateral meeting with Minister Çavuşoğlu just after this press conference, we will continue in the next weeks at different levels to exchange with our Turkish interlocutors on the way forward on this very clear basis.  We had, as George mentioned briefly, a working session with all the candidate countries' Foreign Ministers on our Global Strategy [for the European Union's Foreign and Security Strategy], because it is a common field for common work especially when it comes to security but also stability in our region. I updated the Ministers also on the work of the Defence Ministers yesterday so that candidate countries can have a direct insight to what the process entails, because they will one day be part of this work from the inside. And also because enlargement – what we call enlargement, the accession process, is in itself an element both of European Union security, of the European Union strategy to increase resilience in our region especially with our support to reforms – be it economic, institutional, political reforms or the support to rule of law.  Obviously the exchange was also the opportunity to discuss openly, frankly, constructively I would say among ourselves about different issues that are of concern for most us around the table and I am sure we will continue this conversation even more informally during the evening as we will continue our evening still with the candidate countries' Foreign Ministers.  As George was saying, we had a session on how the European Union can help Europeans to manage the effects of globalisation. It is indeed through the European Union that Europeans can have an impact on managing and shaping some of the aspects of globalisation; when it comes to maximising opportunities, when it comes to solving or managing challenges especially in the field of international free and fair trade, when it comes to some of the big global agendas that are in this moment currently put under question, I think of the climate change agreement; of the overall approach to multilateralism and peacekeeping, the support to the UN system but also our strong and common commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, including our work on the G7 and G20 agenda, on financial regulations, on managing the outcome of the effects of the economic crisis of the last years, increasing competitiveness, reducing inequalities both in the world and inside the European Union. We have exchanged in details about that, sharing the view that we have to use even more our common Union, to bring the European interest and agenda and values also on the global scene, using our European Union to strengthen our impact on globalisation. And as you might know, I was already doing part of this work in the last week with my visit to China, India and Russia; I will continue visiting our major partners in the world on this agenda, also obviously on some bilateral issues but mainly on how the European Union and some global partners or interlocutors can strengthen rules based global order and a system of governance of globalisation that can defend our citizens better.  Thank you.  Q and A:  Q. The German Foreign Minister [ Sigmar Gabriel] asked for a visa free travel for certain parts of the Turkish population – journalists, artists, intellectuals. Do you think that this would be possible and that this is a way to go? Is it your assessment that after implementing the constitutional changes, Turkey will be in a position to meet the Copenhagen criterion and eventually become a member of the European Union?  On your last question it depends very much on how the implementation will take place. When, first of all - I think that the calendar is not yet determined. We understand that some of the provisions might be taken in quite short time but others might take place during this year. It will depend on the way on which Turkey will implement amendments, when and how. That is why I stressed the fact that we agreed or we convened among ourselves that we see it as key that this is done in line with the recommendations of the Venice Commission and also with the observations of the OSCE/ODHIR mission. So it will depend very much on Turkey.  On the first question on visa liberalisation, we have an ongoing dialogue and negotiations with Turkey on visa liberalisation as such. We will have to see together with the Turkish interlocutors how we proceed on that, where we stand and I would leave this at that stage for the moment, also because you know the basic rule of any kind of dialogue and partnership is that you tend to get there with a very clear ideas on how you approach the table, but then you enter into a serious conversation and exchange with the other part and you bring that forward together.  Q. After this conversation today, knowing that there were no formal decisions and that it was just a discussion, do you have any clear sense of what a partnership with Turkey that was not oriented to membership at the EU would look like? Were there ideas floating of what a meaningful cooperation could look like without accession?  You know, I think I am on the record in the last couple of years saying that Turkey is not only a candidate country, that Turkey is also a strategic partner for the European Union on many different things. Turkey is essential from the European Union perspective when it comes to settling the Cyprus issue, Turkey is essential when it comes to counterterrorism cooperation, it is an essential partner when it comes to the crisis in Syria, it is a NATO ally, it is a member of G20, it is an economic partner. Actually, the European Union is the first economic and trade partner of Turkey. So our relation with Turkey goes beyond the accession negotiations and covers many other different fields relevant both for Turkey and the European Union. So when it comes to what type of relationship we have, this covers different fields, issues and can take different forms.  As I said, we today can say that on the European Union side the process of negotiation on accession continues. It is not suspended, it is not ended, but, as I said, at the moment there is no work ongoing to open new chapters. And there are, and this is always the case with all the candidate countries, extremely clear criteria, very well-known from the beginning to all our interlocutors - and especially those on the rule of law, human rights, democracy, freedoms are very well known to our Turkish counterparts.  So now it is on them to express their willingness to continue to be a candidate country, to continue to be interested or not to join our family. The rules of the club are clear, if you want to enter you know what you can expect. We would be happy to have them in, but a level of clarification is needed I would say on their side on this. On our side we are clear where we stand.  Q. Can you tell us exactly how frank and open the language was being used towards Turkey given that some EU countries felt deeply alienated by Nazi allegations President [of Turkey, Recep Tayyip] Erdogan made during the referendum campaign for example?  We had two different sessions. We had one session among us at 28 where we discussed the present and the future of our relations with Turkey, all very open and frank discussions but not particularly dramatic otherwise I would not have been in the position of presenting to you some common ground that is quite substantial.  But they were very frank, very open and this is exactly the spirit of the informal ministerial meetings which are not pressed to achieve a final communiqué, or agreeing on a wording or taking a formal decision. We have the luxury of taking our time, reflecting a little bit more in a strategic manner, listening to each other carefully and understanding what the sense of direction is, so extremely frank.  The afternoon session was not a EU-Turkey session. It was a session that we have regularly every time we have an informal meeting of foreign ministers together with all candidate countries. It would have been completely inappropriate for any of the candidate countries to somehow hijack or monopolise the conversation over bilateral issues between the European Union and any of them. This is not the spirit of the exchange and this was not happening.  Obviously we also raised from time to time some issues not only regarding Turkey by the way, but also some other candidate countries present at the table that are of concern or that are on our agenda. This being an informal meeting and being clearly not my role to disclose single positions expressed around the table, I would not do it, but I can tell you that the overall spirit was frank, open, but very constructive and very positive. Things that needed to be said were said but this was not the first time. We meet often, not only with our Turkish interlocutors, also with other candidate countries. I would say that this is the added-value of being able to be clear among ourselves and with our partners.

European Commission approves disbursement of  EUR 23 million in assistance to Georgia,27.04.2017,27.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/25268_en,,"The European Commission, on behalf of the EU, has today approved the disbursement of the second tranche of EUR 23 million under its Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) to Georgia. The funds – EUR 10 million in grants and EUR 13 million in low-interest loans – will be disbursed in May 2017. EUR   This is the final instalment of the second of two MFA operations, each in an amount of EUR 46 million. The first one was fully disbursed in 2009-2010. Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxations and Customs, said: The disbursement decided today is part of the EU's long-standing support to Georgia and its citizens. On the back of successful completion of critical reform commitments and improved stability, but at a time when our partner continues to face a challenging balance-of-payments and fiscal situation, the EU's assistance will help alleviate Georgia's short-term financing needs. It will also support the implementation of key reforms aimed at boosting economic growth and job creation, reinforcing social safety nets and strengthening the stability of the financial sector. The EU’s MFA programme was intended to strengthen Georgia's external and budgetary positions and to support the government's agenda of economic, social and financial reforms. The policy programme attached to the EU's assistance, which was jointly agreed by Georgia and the EU in December 2014, included measures aimed at improving public finance management, fostering social inclusiveness and strengthening financial supervision. It also contained measures related to trade and competition policies, which aimed to help Georgia fully reap the benefits of the EU-Georgia Association Agreement (AA), including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed in 2014, provisionally applied from September 2014 and entered into force in July 2016. Background Macro-financial assistance (MFA) operations are part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring countries and are intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. They are available to EU partner countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments issues. EU assistance to Georgia is also delivered through other financial instruments, such as budget support. In August 2013, the EU approved an MFA programme for Georgia of up to EUR 46 million, to be disbursed in two equal tranches of EUR 23 million. The European Commission signed a memorandum of understanding with Georgia in December 2014 and disbursed the first MFA tranche in early 2015 (EUR 13 million in grants in January 2015 and EUR 10 million in loans in April 2015). This second and final instalment follows the recent agreement between Georgia and the International Monetary Fund on a new assistance programme. Based on the findings gathered during a review mission conducted in November 2015, the Commission concluded that Georgia had implemented all MFA policy measures associated with the second tranche of MFA (worth EUR 10 million in grants and EUR 13 million in loans). The disbursement of this tranche was foreseen to take place in 2016, but had to be delayed due to the lack of progress with the implementation of Georgia's programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). With the approval by the IMF Executive Board of a new $285 million Extended Fund Facility for Georgia on 12 April 2017, the Commission has decided to proceed with the disbursement of the second tranche of MFA. This MFA programme for Georgia is the second of two operations pledged by the EU at the International Donor Conference which took place in Brussels in October 2008, in the aftermath of the military conflict with Russia. A previous EU MFA programme for Georgia, also amounting to EUR 46 million and exclusively composed of grants, had been successfully implemented in 2009-2010. Bruxelles"
25 April 2017 meeting of the JCPOA Joint Commission,25.04.2017,25.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/25069_en,,"Chair's statement following the 25 April 2017 meeting of the JCPOA Joint Commission A meeting of the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) took place on 25 April 2017 in Vienna. This was the 5th meeting of the Joint Commission since JCPOA Implementation Day. Under the terms of the JCPOA, the Joint Commission is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the nuclear deal. The Joint Commission was chaired, on behalf of EU High Representative Mogherini, by EEAS Secretary General Helga Schmid and was attended by the E3+3 (China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, United States) and Iran at the level of Political Directors/Deputy Foreign Ministers. The meeting provided the opportunity to address the implementation of the JCPOA with regard to nuclear and sanctions related commitments. The Joint Commission particularly welcomed the important progress made on the Arak modernisation project, where Chinese and Iranian companies signed the first consultancy services contract on Sunday, 23 April, in Vienna. Participants discussed the importance of implementation of Annex III of the JCPOA on civil nuclear cooperation, and welcomed in this context the recent EU-Iran high-level seminar on international nuclear cooperation. All participants noted  their continued adherence to JCPOA commitments and stressed the need to ensure its full and effective implementation. Vienna"
Remarks by HR/VP Mogherini at the joint press conference with Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov,25.04.2017,25.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/25043_en,,"EU High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini met Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on April 24th. During their joint press conference she made the following remarks: ʺOn my side also I found the exchanges we started this morning – and that we will continue after this press point – useful, constructive. It is always better to have a direct dialogue and, indeed, even if this is my first visit in my current capacity [as the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission] to Moscow, Sergey and I had several occasions to meet during these last two-and-a-half years, to work together – as well as our teams – constantly coordinated on certain issues. We always believe in the European Union that dialogue – constructive, open dialogue, frank dialogue – is the way. And this is true also for a relevant – not only neighbour – but a global player as the Russian Federation is. There are some issues of disagreement. We are open and frank about that. For sure, we have a different assessment of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. But we have also on that crisis exchanged views on how we can move forward on an agreed roadmap, which is the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement by all sides, both on the security and on the political aspects. We believe in the European Union that it is even more urgent to do so after the death of one of the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission] monitors yesterday in the east of Ukraine. We discussed ways in which we can work together more to guarantee a full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all sides and ways to put an end to the conflict in the east of Ukraine. We also exchanged views on something that maybe you could refer to as a ""systemic disagreement"" – I think you [Sergey Lavrov] mentioned it like this – which is the position of the European Union of not recognising the annexation of Crimea. This is a principled position that we are going to keep – not only the European Union, but also other partners that we have in the world. We had a long exchange on a series of bilateral issues. On some of them we have difficulties to overcome through cooperation and dialogue. On others we have a good level of interaction and cooperation, that is mutually beneficial to our people, both Russian citizens and citizens in the European Union. And we have decided to work on these common issues – the example of the counter-terrorism dialogue that has resumed in the last months is a good one. But we also identified further areas of useful cooperation to be strengthened like cooperation in the Arctic or the Northern Dimension, or exchanges in the cultural, educational or research fields. I could continue on a long list. We started to go through our common agenda of priorities when it comes to global and regional foreign policy issues. Starting with the situation in Syria, I thanked Foreign Minister Lavrov for the active participation of the Russian Federation in the Brussels Conference [Supporting the Future of Syria and the region] a couple of weeks ago, where we not only reaffirmed the very sustained humanitarian support of the international community to the Syrian people, both within Syria and in the region – the European Union is and will continue to be the first humanitarian donor for Syrians – and we share the same approach that access of humanitarian aid has to be improved. We count on Russian work, including through the Astana process, to help to move forward also in this respect. And we shared views on how to work more closely on the political solution of the war in Syria. I believe we share an interest: that of putting an end to this war, that is costing so many lives, that is causing so much pain, to Syrians first of all, but also in the broader region. And we share the interest to guarantee that that part of our neighbourhood is finally finding peace, stability and security, defeating Da'esh and guaranteeing a democratic, inclusive, secular, united future for Syria within the framework of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, through intra-Syrian talks that are UN-facilitated in Geneva and on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We exchanged views on how to follow-up our work in this respect, especially on the political side. Other issues of common interest and concern when it comes to foreign, global and regional security include Libya; the peace process between Israel and Palestine, where the European Union and Russia work well together within the Quartet  and with our Arab partners, including with the Arab Peace Initiative; the full implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran; and, in general terms, the encouragement of a more constructive approach across the Gulf and in the broader Middle East. But we will also discuss in the continuation of our talks some other issues of mutual concern where the Russian Federation and the European Union can constructively work together, not only for the sake of European and Russian interests but also for global stability and multilateralism and respect of international law when it comes to, for instance, the issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula or the peace process in Afghanistan, and our common work on some key global issues for us, be it global responsibility-sharing when it comes to managing huge migratory flows or the work to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change or the Sustainable Development Goals. In general terms, I believe our common work can be essential to strengthen the UN system and the multilateral approach and what we call a rules-based global order. Again, this does not delete or overcome all the difficulties and all the disagreements we have, especially in some areas and especially on the issue of Ukraine, but there are also fields of cooperation, and we are determined to increase the level of coordination and cooperation, exploring possible ways in which Russia and the European Union can be useful to solve some of the crises we are facing in the world of today. We live in difficult times; times when not even one single inch, not one single centimetre of cooperation can be wasted or under-estimated. So, we have the responsibility to do the utmost to find common ground and common solutions. We also have some other issues of disagreement or respective concerns that we also discussed in a friendly and open dialogue, but, as I said, overall I shared the Minister's assessment that this exchange was useful, constructive, positive and we will follow this up not only in the course of the day but also in the coming weeks and months. Thank youʺ. More information: original text of HR/VP Mogherini remarks Moscow"
Remarks by HR/VP Mogherini at the joint press conference with Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov,24.04.2017,24.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24982_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference with Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov Check against delivery! Thank you. Thank you, Sergey [Lavrov, Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation]. On my side also I found the exchanges we started this morning – and that we will continue after this press point – useful, constructive. It is always better to have a direct dialogue and, indeed, even if this is my first visit in my current capacity [as the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission] to Moscow, Sergey and I had several occasions to meet during these last two-and-a-half years, to work together – as well as our teams – constantly coordinated on certain issues. We always believe in the European Union that dialogue – constructive, open dialogue, frank dialogue – is the way. And this is true also for a relevant – not only neighbour – but a global player as the Russian Federation is. There are some issues of disagreement. We are open and frank about that. For sure, we have a different assessment of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. But we have also on that crisis exchanged views on how we can move forward on an agreed roadmap, which is the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement by all sides, both on the security and on the political aspects. We believe in the European Union that it is even more urgent to do so after the death of one of the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission] monitors yesterday in the east of Ukraine. We discussed ways in which we can work together more to guarantee a full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all sides and ways to put an end to the conflict in the east of Ukraine. We also exchanged views on something that maybe you could refer to as a ""systemic disagreement"" – I think you [Sergey Lavrov] mentioned it like this – which is the position of the European Union of not recognising the annexation of Crimea. This is a principled position that we are going to keep – not only the European Union, but also other partners that we have in the world. We had a long exchange on a series of bilateral issues. On some of them we have difficulties to overcome through cooperation and dialogue. On others we have a good level of interaction and cooperation, that is mutually beneficial to our people, both Russian citizens and citizens in the European Union. And we have decided to work on these common issues – the example of the counter-terrorism dialogue that has resumed in the last months is a good one. But we also identified further areas of useful cooperation to be strengthened like cooperation in the Arctic or the Northern Dimension, or exchanges in the cultural, educational or research fields. I could continue on a long list. We started to go through our common agenda of priorities when it comes to global and regional foreign policy issues.

Thank you.  Q and A: Q. Did you discuss the issues related to mutual sanctions as well as the prospect of the revision of EU-Russia relations, which was suggested by the Russian side a year ago. And, a follow-up question to Ms Mogherini: Ukrainian officials do not withhold the fact that the current Rada will not consider the laws necessary for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. In this situation, do you discuss this issue with Kyiv? And is there a possibility that the sanctions will be lifted partly before the full implementation of the Minsk agreements provided there is progress in their implementation? HRVP : Thank you. Well, I took note and put on my notes that ""through our cooperation we might get, eventually, to settle everything"". That would be already a good starting point. But - aside from that - our bilateral cooperation is not frozen. My visit here is the most evident demonstration of that, but apart from my visit here, Sergey and I met probably some twenty times in the last couple of years. If that is frozen cooperation… well, for you to assess. It is true that it is not anymore what it used to be or what we would have liked it to be. For years, the European Union and Russia were working on the perspective of a strategic partnership. We would like to go back to a situation of that kind and, as I said, we are ready to explore all possible fields of cooperation on the basis, as Sergey [Lavrov] mentioned, of a pragmatic assessment of our respective interests. In many fields these respective interests coincide: bilaterally, regionally and globally. But it would be quite surreal to be and to consider each other as strategic partners and to have respective sanctions. This is not the state of play that partners normally have. So we cannot pretend that there was nothing wrong going on in 2014 – we discussed it a length, not only today but over these years. Our sanctions are not an objective in themselves. We have always said – consistently and united, as the European Union, all the 28 Member States – that we see this as only one part of a policy whose aim is to end the conflict in the east of Ukraine with the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Part of our sanctions are also related to the annexation of Crimea where it is quite clear that our views differ profoundly: we believe it is a breach of international law. But these are arguments we have exchanged among ourselves since then.  What we discussed today, in a constructive manner I believe, is the common work we can do to guarantee that the implementation of [the] Minsk [agreements] in all its aspects can move forward. Obviously we do discuss with our friends in Kyiv their side of the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, as we discussed together with our Russian friends what more they can do to guarantee that the Minsk agreements are fully implemented. So our objective is the end of the conflict in the east of Ukraine and the sanctions are linked to that, because – without wanting to go back to 2014 – we see very differently the origins of the conflict. Having said that, we share I believe the interest in making our relations better, expanding the fields of cooperation, as I said, both bilaterally and on regional and global issues. Also because the world of today definitely needs – from an economic, a security point of view, a geopolitical point of view – cooperation rather than confrontation. Q. Recently, you, Minister Lavrov, had negotiations with US State Secretary Tillerson where it was mentioned that the investigation into what happened in Khan-Seikhoun and in the Al Shayrat airport would be renewed. Is it really possible taking into account that the majority of OPCW voted against the proposal put forward by Russia and Iran? I also have a question to Ms Mogherini. What is your position on the fact that the Al Shayrat airport was attacked with 59 American missiles bypassing international rules, the UN Charter and all norms? And one more question. The parliament delegation of PACE visited Syria and its report mentions that there are positive developments, that there is progress in Syria. Does the EU have plans to send its own delegation to Syria? HRVP : On that morning of 4 April, I was in Brussels meeting with some civil society organisations coming from Syria and some of them during the attack lost colleagues, friends, family. I say this because the war in Syria is causing an extreme number of civilian casualties and deaths. But when it gets to the use of chemical weapons, of chemical components, during the war, then we are at a different stage. We are at a different stage of atrocities and we are at the level of what amounts to a war crime if that is proven to be the case. This is why the European position on that is that a full transparent investigation has to be done by the OPCW [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] and full accountability has to be guaranteed within the UN appropriate system. Coming to your question on the EU presence in Damascus. First of all, you started by saying that there are also some positive developments in Syria. Well, this is not the assessment we hear from our Syrian interlocutors. The situation in the country is still dramatic and even if there are attempts – serious attempts that we welcome especially in the Astana process – to have a ceasefire observed, still there are losses of lives and fighting on a daily basis in different parts of the country. And the European Union is very clear in not being a military actor on the field, but only working for a peaceful political solution of the crisis and the humanitarian support to the Syrians. We have a European Union delegation to Syria that has never stopped working, from Beirut, including some contacts in Damascus - we have a humanitarian office of the European Union present in Damascus that is trying to help delivering humanitarian aid in the country, and we will continue to do so.  For us the framework is the UN framework, both for the humanitarian delivery of aid and for the political solution. And we will use and we will continue to use all contacts we have, all the power we can have, without having any European Union agenda for the future of Syria but only that of supporting and accompanying Syrians – all Syrians, none excluded – in finding their way to have a country where each and every Syrian, no matter what background they have, can feel at home. We believe this is the only sustainable basis for putting an end to the war but also for defeating Da'esh and eliminating any space for terrorist organisations to breathe in the country.  Q. Last night, you called Emmanuel Macron ""a hope of the generation"", speaking about French elections. But at the same time, around the same number of French voters rather apparently see Marine Le Pen as their hope and their future. If Russia calls one of the candidates ""a hope for the generation"", would it be accused of interfering in the French elections? And a second one: and are you concerned about the results of the elections that are already showing that around 40% of the voters cast their ballots for the candidates who were calling during their campaigns for a major review of the relations with the EU? Will Brussels do anything about that?  HRVP : What I tweeted yesterday night was that, for me, seeing together EU and French flags welcoming the results of Emmanuel Macron was the hope of a generation. Seeing together the European and the French flags is affirming that a people's identity and a person's identity can be at the same time French and European. And this is how large parts of my generation – which is also Emmanuel's generation – feels about. One can feel a proud Italian, in my case, and a proud European, a proud French and a proud European, as Emmanuel feels, without denying the need to change and reform also our living together in the Union but putting all the energy we have into that. So, I am afraid I did not define Emmanuel as such as the hope of a generation but the fact of seeing European and French flags together. This has to do with the second part of your question. You referred to the fact that a large number of French voters expressed or supported candidates who were putting into question the relation between France and the European Union. You know, it is not a relation, it is a community. The European Union without its Member States does not exist. And this is why commenting on the European Union and the French flags together is not interference; we are living in the same space. This distance that sometimes is perceived - inside or outside of the European Union - between capitals and ""Brussels"" is a fake one. I know that very well because I have been a Minister of a national Member State myself and I can tell you very frankly and very openly it is not ceding sovereignty being part of our Union; the only way we, in the European Union, can regain sovereignty in the globalised world of today, is by coming together. So, the European Union is made of Member States and the sense of lack of distance is what allow us to work together. I chair three formations of the Council of the European Union: Foreign Ministers, Defence Ministers, and Development Ministers, and I know very well that the decisions the European Union takes are not taken by an alien living in Brussels. They are taken by the 28 relevant Ministers that form the decision and the consensus of the European Union. So, the European Union is made of us Europeans including our French friends who voted yesterday night. That is why it was only natural for me to comment and to welcome the fact that putting together the two flags – I would have commented in the same manner if they were appearing in any other rally or political meeting yesterday night – sends exactly the right message, both to the French people and to the European Union that we have a common responsibility to make our Union work and deliver for our people, because the European Union does not exist without the Europeans. It is as simple as that. Q. Members of the gay community in Chechnya have made serious allegations about persecution, mistreatment, torture, even murder in Chechnya - in some cases at the hands of the Chechenian authorities. Has that matter been raised in your dialogue today? Second question: there are more than 30 members of the gay community from Chechnya currently in hiding in Russia, and they say they would desperately want to leave this country. Should the European Union or individual States from the European Union come up with a rescue plan to facilitate their exit?  HRVP : The issue of human rights came up in our dialogue this morning. By the way, before our meeting this morning, I met some representatives of the civil society organisations and human rights defenders with whom I discussed at length this and other issues related the work of civil society and respect of human rights in the Russian Federation. I know that our Russian friends also have some concerns about some human rights issues inside the European Union. This is a frank and mutual dialogue where we hear each other and hopefully also listen to each other without only hearing. You might have seen the common reaction we have had on the specific case of the gay community in Chechnya and the need to protect it. Our expectation is that the Russian Federation does its part to protect its own citizens in full respect of human rights principles. This would cover also the second part of your question. We believe that the authorities of the country hold the primary responsibility of protecting their citizens' rights and, again, this is an issue that we have raised and discussed. Moscow"

The attacker was shot on the scene while a second man, suspected of being linked to the shooting, reportedly surrendered himself in Belgium.  It is with sadness that the EU Delegation to South Africa takes note of last night's terror attack in Paris leaving one police officer dead and two others seriously injured. The attacker was shot on the scene while a second man, suspected of being linked to the shooting, reportedly surrendered himself in Belgium. The murderous assault follows the recent horror attack in Stockholm (7 April) in which a truck was used to mow down pedestrians in a busy shopping district. Four people were killed and 15 were injured. The attacker was arrested shortly after the incident. Earlier, on 22 March - on the day of the one year anniversary of the 2016 Brussels terror attacks that left 32 people dead and more than 300 people wounded - an attacker used a motor vehicle to mow down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London. Four people died and close to 30 were reportedly injured. The attacker subsequently crashed his car into the railings outside the parliament, got out and stabbed a police officer to death before being shot dead by armed police. Beyond these attacks within the European Union there have been well over 100 documented terror incidents recorded elsewhere during the corresponding period. In the worst of these, over 120 people were reportedly killed and over 50 people were injured on 15 April in a suicide bombing in Aleppo, Syria; on 9 April 17 people were killed by a suicide bomber in Mogadishu, Somalia; on the same day two suicide bombers, separately targeting Christian worshippers in Egypt, killed 37 and injured close to 125 people; over 30 people died and over 40 were injured in separate suicide bomber attacks on 4 April in Kirkuk, Iraq; another suicide attack on 3 April left 14 people dead and close to 50 injured in St Petersburg, Russia; a suicide bomber killed 24 and injured 90 people on 31 March in Parachinar, Pakistan; on the day prior to this a terrorist raid left 12 people dead and over 20 injured in Wumyeduga, Nigeria; and finally 17 people reportedly died and close to 60 were injured when a suicide bomber detonated a truck in a crowded Baghdad street on 20 March 2017. EU Ambassador to South Africa, Dr Marcus Cornaro, stated with reference to the recent spate of terror attacks that the European Union strongly condemns all acts of terror and confirmed the EU's continued commitment to work towards a safer and terror-free world. In this regard he emphasised that the EU remained united in the fight against all extremism. Contact: Frank Oberholzer 012-452-5261 or frank.oberholzer@eeas.europa.eu  South Africa"

"Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the alleged chemical attack in Idlib, Syria",07.04.2017,07.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24376_en,,"The EU condemns in the strongest terms the air strike that hit the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province on 4 April 2017, which has had horrific consequences, causing the deaths and injuries of scores of civilians including children and relief workers, with many victims displaying symptoms of gas poisoning. The EU condemns in the strongest terms the air strike that hit the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province on 4 April 2017, which has had horrific consequences, causing the deaths and injuries of scores of civilians including children and relief workers, with many victims displaying symptoms of gas poisoning. The EU urges the United Nations Security Council to come together, strongly condemn the attack on Khan Sheikhoun and ensure a swift, independent and impartial investigation of the attack. The OPCW's Fact Finding Mission (FFM) is in the process of gathering and analysing information from all available sources. While the investigation into this attack is ongoing, the EU is deeply worried to note that the Syrian regime has previously used chemical weapons in 2015, as identified in the August and October reports of the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism, and which the EU strongly condemned at the time. In this context, the EU reiterates that as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Syrian regime has explicitly obligated itself to refrain from the use of chemical weapons and that the Syrian regime has the primary responsibility for the protection of the Syrian population. The EU therefore calls on the regime's allies, notably Russia, to exercise appropriate pressure on the Syrian regime to this end. The use of chemical weapons or chemical substances as weapons amounts to a war crime. Their use in Syria, including by the regime and Da'esh, must stop and identified perpetrators must be held accountable for this violation of international law. Those guilty of violations of international law and the use of chemical weapons have to be sanctioned accordingly. In March, the EU added 4 high-ranking Syrian military officials to the sanctions list for their role in the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population, in line with the EU's policy to fight the proliferation and use of chemical weapons. The EU will continue to support the efforts of the OPCW in Syria with regard to the investigation of the use of chemical weapons and considers that such efforts have to be continued in the future by the international community. This attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the ceasefire. It underlines the urgent need for a real and verified ceasefire. The EU calls on Russia, Turkey and Iran to live up to their commitments as guarantors in this regard. Attacks of this kind only reinforce the urgent need for a genuine political transition in Syria and the EU's will to support UN efforts to broker a political solution to the Syrian conflict through the intra-Syrian talks in Geneva, as reaffirmed at the International Conference ""Supporting the future of Syria and the region"" that the EU hosted in Brussels on 5 April 2017.

БУДКИН: Среда, 5 апреля. Программа «Умные парни». Радиостанция «Говорит Москва». Меня зовут Юрий Будкин. И наш гость Вигаудас Ушацкас - посол Евросоюза в России. Вигаудас, здравствуйте. В.

Номер смс-портала +7-8888-94-8, можно писать через Telegram пользователю govoritmskbot. Первый вопрос, конечно, касается юбилея Евросоюза. 60 лет было буквально несколько лет назад. Хотя уже больше недели, 25 марта, Евросоюз отмечал юбилей Римского договора. Это такой, как это по-русски принято говорить, юбилей со слезами на глазах или юбилей с уверенностью в завтрашнем дне? В. УШАЦКАС: Это юбилей с гордостью и с полным пониманием вызовов и угроз, с которыми столкнулся Евросоюз, до сих пор объединяющий 28 стран-членов. Гордость в том смысле, что этот проект является для всего мира примером того, как через экономическую и политическую интеграцию мы можем избежать войны. И это было признано Нобелевской премией, которая была вручена Европейскому союзу в 2012 году. Если цитировать Черчилля, то это то, что два мародёра, война и тирания, почти полностью изгнаны с нашего континента. Это, конечно, самый большой пример, который мы смогли сделать совместно с конца Второй мировой войны или с 1957 года. Мы гордимся тем, что Европейский союз является крупнейшей экономикой в мире. Мы являемся крупнейшим торговым партнёром для 80 стран мира. Мы экспортируем в два раза больше, чем Китай, и в три раза больше, чем США. Евро по важности является второй мировой резервной валютой. Я тоже хотел бы обратить внимание, что Европейский союз является главным мировым донором в области развития гуманитарной помощи, особенно для стран, которые сейчас переживают конфликты: был бы это Афганистан, Сирия или африканские страны. Мы также являемся мировым лидером в исследованиях и инновациях, о которых очень хорошо знают ваши российские учёные, так как они самые активные участники в наших софинансированных программах, таких как «Горизонт 2020». Ученые, экономисты, активисты Европейского союза получили самое большое число Нобелевских премий вообще в истории. Опять-таки равенство между мужчинами и женщинами является одной из основополагающих ценностей Евросоюза, и что мы видим – разница в зарплатах мужчин и женщин сократилась до 16%. Ещё важный аспект, который бы я хотел отметить, и по которому мы хотим и заинтересованы работать с Российской Федерацией и с мировым обществом, о чём мы недавно говорили в Архангельске на состоявшемся экологическом форуме, - это то, что мы были первые в мире, которые разработали свою собственную европейскую экологическую политику. Мы показали на своём примере, что устойчивое развитие и экологический прогресс могут идти вместе. Между 1990 и 2015 годами мы сократили выбросы CO2 на 22%, а за это время наша экономика выросла на 50%. Последнее это то, что мы гордимся тем, что богатство культуры Европейского союза сделало наши страны ведущими туристическими направлениями в мире. Мы рады тому, что самое большое число шенгенских виз как раз выдается российским гражданам, независимо от политических напряжений, с которыми мы столкнулись в течение последних трёх лет. С другой стороны, мы открыто смотрим вызовам и угрозам, которые выходят изнутри и извне. И я лично, и лидеры Европейского союза сожалеем, что Соединённое королевство Великобритания приняло решение начать процесс по выходу из Европейского союза. Я думаю, что это станет важным толчком, уже стало, чтобы мы осмыслили, в каком направлении будет развиваться Европейский союз в будущем. Конечно, когда 1 член семьи заинтересован выйти из семьи Европейского союза, то это делает такой большой негативный эффект не только экономически, политически, но и психологически. Опять-таки, если вы будете следить и оценивать историю Европейского союза, очевидно, что всё его развитие произошло от кризиса до кризиса, и каждый раз мы выходили более сильными и более зрелыми. Поэтому и президент Еврокомиссии Жан-Клод Юнкер буквально пару недель или месяц тому назад опубликовал свои отметки и осмысления, каким образом Европейский союз должен развиваться, возможные пассионарии, которые сейчас будут обсуждать. Я думаю, что самое главное, чтобы мы выдержали единство 28 стран союза. Я думаю, что мы найдём новые формальные отношения с Великобританией, которые бы соответствовали обоюдным интересам. И самое главное, чтобы в этом единстве мы показывали также и то стратегическое направление, которое бы служило в интересах наших граждан по безопасности, по экономическому развитию и по разным другим вопросам. Ю. БУДКИН: Хорошо, но всё-таки почти безоблачное небо в будущем над Евросоюзом… В. УШАЦКАС: Я так не говорил. Я говорил, что есть большие вызовы и угрозы. Ю. БУДКИН: Да, вызовы и угрозы, но всё-таки вы, в основном, говорили о достижениях. В. УШАЦКАС: Иногда Россия тоже не помогает, а создаёт угрозы и вызовы. Ю. БУДКИН: Так вот, я просто посмотрел, какие формулировки используют в русском языке в русских СМИ про Евросоюз. Есть среди прочих такая – «раздираемый противоречиями Евросоюз». Это не имеет права на существование? Этого нет на самом деле? В. УШАЦКАС: Мы признаём те сложности и те угрозы, которые появились извне Европейского союза. Что касается внутренних угроз, то это то, что мы признаём, что впервые в истории Евросоюза молодое поколение может жить меньше, что их доходы будут не такие большие, как у того поколения, которое сейчас живёт, и это для нас является одной из таких больших озабоченностей. Мы признаём те экономические сложности, с которыми сталкиваются некоторые страны Европейского союза, тот мировой финансовый кризис, который начался в 2008 году. Но мы, о чем я говорил, также сожалеем, что одна очень важная страна для нас всех Великобритания решила начать процесс выхода из Европейского союза. Но есть и другие внешние вызовы. Это отношения с Россией, которые признаются официально как особенно проблематичными из-за нелегальной аннексии Крыма, из-за дестабилизации Восточной Украины, и, конечно, это не помогает нам продвигать нормальные отношения, которые, как я думаю, такие страны, как ЕС и Россия, заслуживают. Ю. БУДКИН: Тогда подождите… обычно, когда говорят про раздираемый противоречиями Евросоюз, пытаются говорить о том, что туда много понаехало людей, к примеру, из Северной Африки, что есть совершенно разные интересы между старыми членами Евросоюза и молодыми членами или иначе можно сказать крупными странами Европы и небольшими странами, скажем, как страны Балтии. Вот этих противоречий нет? В. УШАЦКАС: Я бы хотел отделить два аспекта одного вопроса. Один – это беженцы и миграция, а другой – как отдельные страны строят свои отношения в отношении других стран Европейского союза и каким образом вообще происходит принятие решений. Что касается первого, то я думаю, что мы, во-первых, являемся не только финансовым донором, но также и привержены тем нормам и международным актам, которые регламентируют права беженцев и мигрантов. И то, что мы приняли полтора миллиона из Северной Африки и Ближнего Востока, показывает нашу ответственную роль как государств-правительств, а также доброту граждан Европейского союза в отношении тех людей, которые избегают войны и конфликтов. Это первое. Я думаю, что мы хотя и столкнулись с большим потоком, смогли найти ответственный и правильный ответ. Второй аспект, что вы упомянули, - это отношения между старыми и новыми членами Европейского союза, которые вступили 13 лет тому назад. Есть другие критерии, по которым можно иногда видеть другие оценки: это и структура экономик, и состояние социально-экономического склада отдельной страны. Но по существу я хотел бы сказать, что сама суть Европейского союза является в том, что мы являемся союзом суверенным 28 стран, у которых есть разная история, даже бывают разные восприятия по одним или другим конфликтам. Я имею и широту нашу, разнообразие наших интересов и проблематик. Конечно, южные страны Европейского союза воспринимают конфликты и то, что происходит на севере Африки, гораздо глубже и чувствительнее, чем северные страны или страны Центральной Европы. Тоже самое можно сказать и о конфликте на Украине или отношениях с Россией, потому что непосредственные соседи уже в восточных странах Европейского союза гораздо чувствительнее и гораздо внимательнее следят и делают свои высказывания по отношению к тому, что происходит в Украине или с Россией. Но самое главное, на что я хотел обратить внимание – это то, что независимо от этих исторических опытов, независимо от географического положения разных стран Европейского союза – от Португалии до Литвы и Эстонии, всё-таки мы всегда, когда принимаем решение, достигаем консенсуса, общего понимания, общих положений, которые представляют единую позицию всех 28 стран Европейского союза. Ю. БУДКИН: Когда 493-ий пытается провести аналогию между Европейским союзом и Советским союзом, то это неправильно. Он пишет: «В Советском союзе тоже было много стран. Пусть, не 28, но 18». Не знаю откуда эта цифра, но дальше: «Мы тоже во многих отраслях были лидерами как Евросоюз, но где теперь Советский союз?» В. УШАЦКАС: Я не знаю кто такой 493-ий… Ю. БУДКИН: Просто один из наших слушателей. Он просто не подписывается, а это часть номера его телефона. В. УШАЦКАС: Знаете, мне довелось жить во времена Советского союза, так что я помню эти времена… Ю. БУДКИН: То есть там не было консенсуса между разными частями… В. УШАЦКАС: Вы же все знали кто руководил, была одна партия, было одно руководство и одна директива. Сравнивать Советский союз и Европейский союз невозможно. Ю. БУДКИН: И ещё один вопрос. Вы сказали, что удалось все эти 60 лет пройти без серьёзных военных конфликтов. 276-ой спрашивает: «То есть то, что произошло на Кипре, и то, что было в Югославии, вы не считаете военным конфликтом?». В. УШАЦКАС: Я имел в виду на территории стран Европейского союза, что конфликтов с создания Союза с 1957 года, с того момента, когда страны присоединилась к Европейскому союзу, на их территории войны не происходили. И в этом успех и признание Европейского союза как самого могучего, самого признательного мирного проекта. Ю. БУДКИН: Теперь ещё. Последние дни здесь в России очень много говорят о террористах после того, что произошло в Санкт-Петербурге. Можно ли говорить о сотрудничестве России и Евросоюза, об эффективном сотрудничестве в смысле борьбы с терроризмом? Я посмотрел ваши интервью. Вы говорили о том, что мы много лет сотрудничаем, и даже русские к нам приезжали, но мы всё к русским собираемся, собираемся, вот в феврале вы говорили будет какой-то разговор на эту тему… что-то случилось? Насколько это всё эффективно? В. УШАЦКАС: Во-первых, я бы хотел ещё раз выразить мои личные и от имени Европейского союза соболезнования родным и близким погибших при взрыве метро в Санкт-Петербурге в понедельник. Всем раненым желаю скорейшего выздоровления. Мы как Евросоюз осуждаем самым решительным образом любые акты насилия. Об этом было высказано много раз, и это передала госпожа Могерини в своём письме Сергею Лаврову. Я хотел бы отметить, что диалог между Евросоюзом и Москвой по антитеррористической тематике никогда не прекращался. У нас были консультации год тому назад, я встречаюсь с высокопоставленными лицами из разных институций России, особенно с господином Сыромолотовым, заместителем министра иностранных дел, который занимается этой тематикой, так и с другими замминистрами, которые это курируют. Например, Михаил Богданов курирует Ближний Восток и Северную Африку, и мы совсем недавно, как вы отметили, по-моему, в феврале у нас состоялись официальные консультации по антитерроризму. У нас план разработан, как мы это будем продолжать. То, что случилось в Петербурге, к сожалению, и эти акты, которые случились в Европе, являются очевидным примером, что ЕС и Россия должны работать совместно. Не только консультироваться между Брюсселем и Москвой, но и искать общие подходы к этим конфликтам, к этим источникам, которые рождают международных террористов. Во-первых, незаконченный конфликт в Афганистане, продолжающееся кровопролитие в Сирии, конфликты в Йемене или Ливии. Конечно, мы здесь очень ценим региональные экспертизы российских дипломатов и специалистов. Мы рады тому, замминистр иностранных дел господин Гатилов сегодня как раз находится на конференции по вопросам Сирии, которая организуется Европейским союзом и рядом других стран в Брюсселе. Как раз сегодня не только Европейский союз, но также Кувейт, Норвегия, Катар, Великобритания, ООН и Германия совместно проводят эту конференцию, в которой принимает участие 70 делегаций. И надеемся, что во время сегодняшней встречи мы сможем дать дополнительный импульс как этим обязательствам, которые были взяты год тому назад во время лондонской конференции о поддержи Сирии и региона, что касается финансовой и гуманитарной поддержки, но также и можем сделать позитивный импульс для успешного завершения межсирийских переговоров под эгидой ООН в Женеве, направленных для достижение политического соглашения, для завершения конфликта на основе определенных резолюций Совета безопасности ООН. Ю. БУДКИН: И всё-таки это, в основном, консультации. Какой-то практической деятельности на уровне правоохранительных структур не наблюдается? Или она уже идёт помимо этих политических договорённостей? В. УШАЦКАС: Конечно, помимо политического диалога связи поддерживаются, и определённые институции меняются информацией. Я бы не хотел углубляться сейчас на конкретные примеры, но я сам знаю, во время моих переговоров с коллегами из России, что независимо от этих политических разногласий по Украине и другим вопросам, конкретная работа по антитерроризму продолжалась всё время. Ю. БУДКИН: Возвращаясь к политическим разногласиям. Вы уже раза три упомянули, что между Евросоюзом и Российской Федерацией есть определённые сложности в последнее время. Как вы можете охарактеризовать взаимоотношения? Тут трудно сказать двух стран, потому что с одной стороны страна, а с другой – целый союз из 28 на данный момент стран. Но как вы всё-таки можете охарактеризовать взаимоотношения России и Евросоюза? В. УШАЦКАС: Во-первых, надо признать, к сожалению, в течение последних трёх лет мы и события, особенно в Украине, изменили внешнюю политику России и отношения между Европейским союзом и Россией. У нас сохраняются фундаментальные разногласия, некоторые из них, действительно, серьёзные. Это и незаконная аннексия Крыма, и подрыв системы европейской безопасности, и разные оценки плюрализма и прав человека, которые в России не всегда принимают политики, что мы наблюдаем в политике экономического национализма, самодостаточности и импортозамещения. С другой стороны, всё-таки надо признать, что мы продолжаем друг другу являться важными стратегически, потому что мы являемся крупнейшими соседями. Европейский союз является крупнейшим торговым партнёром: 43% торговли России происходит с Европейским союзом. Европейские инвеститоры являются самыми большими в экономике России, достигает почти 75% всех иностранных инвестиций. И мы, конечно, заинтересованы искать общий подход и ответы на те сложные и очень важные международные конфликты – Сирия и Афганистан или Ближний Восток – принимая это во внимание 28 министров Европейского союза как раз в марте прошлого года приняли 5 так называемых руководящих принципов взаимодействия с Россией. Первый – это полная реализация минских договоренностей, которая является основным условием для нормализации отношений с Россией. Второй – это то, что мы будем продолжать поддерживать страны восточного партнёрства, что касается их модернизации, реформ экономики и не только. Например, в конце марта, 8 марта, если не ошибаюсь, безвизовый режим уже начался в отношении граждан Грузии, и в июне мы надеемся, что вступит в силу безвизовый режим в ЕС для граждан Украины. Мы также работаем по устойчивости самого Европейского союза, например, в области энергетики и коммуникаций. Но мы также, и министру сказали об этом, что мы будем работать совместно с Россией по вопросам, которые являются общими интересами для нас и для России. Ю. БУДКИН: Несколько вопросов по поводу последних новостей, которые так или иначе появлялись на лентах информационных агентств. Во-первых, было особое заявление европейской службы связи по отношению к прошедшем в России антикоррупционным митингам. Что означает это заявление и должна ли быть какая-то реакция российских властей на неё? В. УШАЦКАС: Конечно, мы следим за событиями не только в России, но и в разных странах мира, особенно, европейских стран, с которыми у нас есть тесные связи, и которые подписали определённые договорённости, взяли на себя обязательства, что касается свободы выражения мнений, ассоциаций, мирных собраний, и мы следили за тем, как происходила мирная демонстрация. Это была мирная демонстрация. Не только в Москве, а почти в 100 городах Российской Федерации, и что люди высказывали своё свободное мнение. Мы призываем Российскую Федерацию выполнить свои международные обязательства, которые она взяла на себя, в том числе и в Совете Европы и в ОБСЕ, - защищать эти права и незамедлительно освободить мирных демонстрантов, которые были задержаны. Ю. БУДКИН: Когда вам говорят о том, что по существующим правилам власти должны санкционировать те или иные митинги, и в данном случае он был несогласованным с властями… Он мирный, но несогласованный с властями. Что делать? В. УШАЦКАС: Как я понимаю, что было всего 100 демонстраций по всей России, и некоторые из них не получили согласования с властями. Мы просто обращаем внимание на то, что разгон демонстрации был всё-таки направлен на мирную демонстрацию, в результате которого были задержаны сотни граждан, в том числе лидер оппозиции Алексей Навальный, что было препятствованием осуществлению основных свобод. И мы ещё раз призываем власти, чтобы демонстранты, которые были задержаны, незамедлительно были освобождены. Ю. БУДКИН: Хорошо. 312-ый спрашивает: «По-вашему мнению, могут ли быть какие-то кардинальные изменения в России, чтобы она в течение ближайших 10-15 лет стала членом Евросоюза?». В. УШАЦКАС: Хороший вопрос. Это зависит от многого. Во-первых, заинтересована ли Россия вступить в Евросоюз. Но это вопрос вы должны ответить в какой-то момент. Другое также надо признать, что по договорам основания Европейского союза предусмотрено его расширение, и есть для этого 2 основных критерия. Первые – возможный кандидат-страна разделяет ли те же самые ценности демократии, плюрализма и свободы слова, политического разнообразия. Это одно. И второе – это конкурентоспособность экономики. В конце концов, решение принимается на политической уровне. Я сам как бывший главный переговорщик Литвы по вступлению в Евросоюз хорошо помню, что дорога в ЕС была не такой уж лёгкой. Но в данный момент давайте будем реалистами и откровенными, что мы не видим ни заинтересованности со стороны России, ни готовности и заинтересованности расширяться в данный момент со стороны Европейского союза. Ю. БУДКИН: Когда мы говорим про Украину, здесь можно говорить о том, что она по каким-то параметрам не подходит Европейскому союзу? В. УШАЦКАС: Опять-таки я бы хотел ещё раз повторить, что никто из Евросоюза не толкает Украину в Евросоюз. Украина сама выразила заинтересованность стать членом Европейского союза. Мы не ответили на это положительно. Мы ответили только тем, что предложили другим странам, Грузии, Молдове подписать соглашение по свободной торговле и по Ассоциации между Союзом, Украиной, Грузией и Молдовой. Так что, как я говорил, и это очень ясно выразил президент Еврокомиссии господин Юнкер ещё два года назад, когда он только приступил к должности, что он не рассматривает такого вопроса, что в ближайшем будущем будет дополнительное расширение Евросоюза, имея в виду те вызовы, с которыми мы сталкиваемся в самом Евросоюзе. Но мы будем поддерживать всячески те шаги, которые делаются нашими общими соседями, как такой особенно важной страной Украиной по модернизации их политического, экономического и социального слоя. Я думаю, что должно быть интересно и России сделать свой позитивный положительный вклад для того, чтобы вокруг и в самой Украине ситуация стабилизировалась, и чтобы мы могли развивать отношения уже в нормальном русле в будущем. Ю. БУДКИН: Вы упомянули, что уже этим летом украинцы смогут посещать территорию Евросоюза свободно, без виз. И тут многие наши слушатели спрашивают, что это прямо уже принятое решение, и это 100%, что с июля месяца? В. УШАЦКАС: Да, это 100%. Я не могу сказать, когда это будет, 22 или 28 июня, но то, что они будут иметь возможность посетить Евросоюз без виз до 90 дней за полгода, не обозначает, что приезд без виз даст возможность для работы или какого-то занятия. Безвизовый режим не предоставляет возможности для постоянной жизни или работы. Ю. БУДКИН: То есть туда нельзя переехать. Просто приехать и вернуться. В. УШАЦКАС: Да. Вы как турист, как бизнесмен, как учёный, как журналист, если являетесь гражданином Украины, сможете посещать Европейский союз без визы. Ю. БУДКИН: 7373-94-8. Да, прежде чем мы возьмём первый звонок наших слушателей, много аналогий проводят. Вот вы сказали, не правильно делали в Москве, когда разгоняли мирную демонстрацию… «Но разве на Западе, - пишет 692-ой – не разгоняют несанкционированные митинги?». В. УШАЦКАС: Бывает всякое, но самое главное, что это не бывает в отношении мирных демонстраций. Это первое. Ю. БУДКИН: То есть даже если это несанкционированное собрание людей, их не разгонят, если они просто мирно собираются и что-то там себе говорят. В. УШАЦКАС: Я таких случаев не знаю. Бывают определённые полицейские… они должны присматривать за порядком, но насколько я понимаю, порядка мирные демонстранты придерживались, а самое главное то, что они выражали своё свободное мнение и своё право. Ю. БУДКИН: Теперь ещё. Вы говорили об аннексии Крыма. Это ваша формулировка. И тут очень многие слушатели пишут о том, что «да ведь был же референдум, получается, что воля населения не имеет никакой роли для Евросоюза?». В. УШАЦКАС: Конечно, имеет, если это выполняется, уважая и придерживаясь законодательства конкретной страны. В то время Крым был, с нашей точки зрения, частью Украины. Законодательство Украины это не предусмотрело. Ни одна из международных организаций туда не послала своих экспертов, наблюдателей. Тем более это всё происходило с присутствием, как мы сейчас все знаем, «вежливых» или «зелёных человечков». О свободной воле, когда рядом стоит военный, мы говорить не можем. Ю. БУДКИН: Тогда аналогии. Юрий Каменков пишет: «На Западе Украины теперь выдают венгерские паспорта. Когда в Закарпатье начнут устраивать такой референдум, как на него будет реагировать Евросоюз?». Как на крымский? В. УШАЦКАС: Такого я не знаю. Евросоюз не признает нелегальных референдумов или других каких-то процессов. Ю. БУДКИН: Ну и Евровидение. Это ведь европейская структура. Кто проводит Евровидение? В. УШАЦКАС: Нет, на это важно всё-таки обратить внимание, что Евровидение, которое я сам люблю смотреть, всегда было аполитичным и должно таким остаться. Это не Евросоюз, не Еврокомиссия, не Европарламент организуют. Ю. БУДКИН: То есть Европейский вещательный союз не имеет отношения В. УШАЦКАС: Мне кажется, даже Россия является членом Европейского вещательного союза. Если не ошибаюсь, то это самостоятельная независимая организация. Очень разные есть организации с названием «евро», и они организуют, проводят конкурс Евровидения без вмешательства и какого-то присутствия Еврокомиссии и Европарламента. Ю. БУДКИН: То, что происходит сейчас при подготовке к очередному Евровидению, это не европейская проблема? В. УШАЦКАС: Я думаю, что это проблема Европейского вещательного союза, который организует это мероприятие. И насколько я понимаю, он понимает решение Украины, сделанное на основе украинского законодательства, и в то же время ведёт диалог с Украиной и с Россией с целью найти решение, которое было бы приемлемо для обеих сторон. Ю. БУДКИН: 7373-94-8. Теперь я прошу надеть наушники. Слушаем вас. РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Здравствуйте. Меня зовут Александр. Если позволите, одно маленькое заключение и один вопрос. В. УШАЦКАС: Пожалуйста. РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Я послушал господина Ушацкаса, и могу сказать, если взять математический такой аналог, есть такое понятие «множество», и его можно обозначить как окружность. Так вот мне кажется, что господин Ушацкас в своём выступлении ещё раз подтвердил, что множества России и Евросоюза практически не пересекаются. Может быть, на 2-3%, и, честно говоря, у меня как гражданина России абсолютно нет никакого желания, чтобы эта цифра 1,5-2% каким-то образом увеличилась. Ю. БУДКИН: Господин Ушацкас говорил о том, что у нас очень серьёзные экономические связи. Вы не заметили этого? РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Честно говоря, экономические связи в последнее время сильно так подсели в последние три года, но я как гражданин России не слишком по этому поводу грущу. Ю. БУДКИН: Хорошо, ваш вопрос давайте… РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: И вопрос, если позволите. Господин Ушацкас и Евросоюз по поводу Крыма ещё не поняли, что при всём желании Крым в то сегодняшнее, что осталось от Украины, ни за какие коврижки, никогда и никаким образом не вернётся? Они это поняли или они когда-нибудь это поймут? В. УШАЦКАС: Спасибо, я не очень понял первый комментарий, что вы хотели сказать… Ю. БУДКИН: Александр сказал, что, по его мнению, Европа и Россия теперь практически не пересекаются. В. УШАЦКАС: Это не правда. Если вы спросите информированного эксперта и даже политика, думаю, что все те числа, данные, которые я вам представил, они говорят сами за себя, что Евросоюз, а ни Китай, ни США или кто-то другой является самым крупнейшим торговым партнёром для России. Ю. БУДКИН: Но Александр говорил, что стало намного меньше за последнее три года. В. УШАЦКАС: Стало намного меньше, потому что вы ввели… Россия ввела санкции в отношении торговых товаров. Ю. БУДКИН: Но сначала же были европейские санкции… В. УШАЦКАС: … и унизили… Ю. БУДКИН: …снизился… В. УШАЦКАС: …снизился товарооборот, хотя он снизился по большинству не из-за санкций, а из-за того, что, к сожалению, с экономикой России не так было легко, и это также замечается в товароотношениях не только с ЕС, но также и с Китаем, например, где товарооборот уменьшился на 30%. Ю. БУДКИН: Это мировой кризис, хорошо. Тогда вторая часть вопроса. В. УШАЦКАС: Вторая часть вопроса – поверил ли я или не поверил, знаю или не знаю. Я верю в то и знаю и то, что и мы, и вы жили бы гораздо лучше и стабильнее, процветающее, если бы мы все руководствовались и соблюдали международное право, соблюдали также и территориальную целостность, и суверенитет наших соседей. В этом смысле Европейский союз не будет признавать нелегальной аннексии Крыма, которую осуществила Россия. Ю. БУДКИН: 7373-948, слушаем вас, здравствуйте. РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Добрый день, меня зовут Елена. Я хочу высказать похвалу вашему гостю и вообще тому образу жизни, который сейчас в Европе, а не в России. Я, к сожалению, как обыватель изредка бываю в Европе, в частности в Италии, и я просто вижу, как люди там живут, какие цены там пять лет подряд… Ю. БУДКИН: И ваш вопрос всё-таки… РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: И очень жаль, что у нас в России сложилась вот такая ситуация. Сейчас надо просто бежать отсюда. Ю. БУДКИН: А вопрос в чём? РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Вопрос ни в чём. Ю. БУДКИН: Всё, я понял, спасибо. Давайте всё-таки договоримся, что это будут вопросы господину Ушацкасу, хотя мнение услышано. Слушаем вас, здравствуйте. РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Аллё, здравствуйте. Такой вопрос. Если референдум в Крыме был проведён не по законодательству Украины, тогда смена власти разве прошла по законодательству? Ведь Януковича не могли уволить так, как его уволили? Ю. БУДКИН: А вы изучали этот вопрос? РАДИОСЛУШАТЕЛЬ: Ну да, а разве никто не изучал?! Ю. БУДКИН: Не знаю, просто вы же об этом говорите… Господин Ушацкас… В. УШАЦКАС: Во-первых, я ещё раз хочу повторить, что референдум мы не признаём, потому что это не было в рамках украинского законодательства. Что касается господина Януковича, то это он убежал из своей страны и показал себя самым большим трусом, в результате чего страна должна была каким-то образом найти руководителя. Были проведены парламентские выборы, которые были признаны и самой Россией, а потом президентские выборы. Ю. БУДКИН: «Его же вынудили бежать», - пишут. Юрий Каменков пишет, и Анна напоминает об этом – вы говорите о том, что это был впервые вопрос о целостности границ, но что про Югославию… почему вы забываете про Косово, когда говорите о том, что это было что-то такое необычное? В. УШАЦКАС: Не надо делать параллели между очень разными конфликтами. Факт в том, что в Крыму не было принуждений, не было каких-то кровопролитных событий, не было угроз, в то время как в Косово погибли десятки тысяч обычных граждан. Ю. БУДКИН: То есть надо было дождаться… В. УШАЦКАС: Не надо было дождаться… для этого и существует дипломатия, для этого и существуют международные организации, которые бы превентивно сыграли ту важную роль. Я думаю, что мы все обязаны как раз сделать то, чтобы такие конфликты как в Косово не повторились. Но мы также должны делать всё, чтобы мы все придерживались международного права и одному из самых фундаментальных и важнейших принципов – уважение территориальной целостности и суверенитета. Что вы сделали в отношении сейчас Украины? Что у вас отношения получше? Самых братских два народа сейчас находятся в состоянии войны и конфликта. Сколько людей из-за этого переживает и в России, и в Украине! И я не думаю, что аннексия Крыма каким-то образом положительно сыграла для этих отношений. Я боюсь, что отношения между Россией и Украиной, между народами, между людьми, то, что говорят и сами российские обозреватели, они будут повреждены, к сожалению, на долгое будущее. Ю. БУДКИН: Скажите, вот тут тоже очень много вопросов по поводу стран Балтии. Если можно этот вопрос сформулировать так, как это делает один из наших слушателей – а в Прибалтике реально боятся, что русские сейчас могут на них напасть? В. УШАЦКАС: В Прибалтике реально боятся возможных повторений, которые произошли как в Крыму, так и в Восточной Украине, на Донбассе. В Прибалтике очень с осторожностью и чувствительно принимается информация, когда организуются большие военные манёвры, когда военная техника перекинута в Калининградскую область. И, конечно, люди помнят свою историю. Помнят, как мы потеряли свою независимость в 1940 году, и следят с озабоченностью за тем, как продолжается кризис в Украине. Поэтому, конечно, те высказывания наших балтийских друзей и моих соратников, они основываются на тех фактах, с которыми мы встречаемся. Ю. БУДКИН: Это вопрос о непонимании разных государств или это уже вопросы недопонимания народов? В. УШАЦКАС: Я сейчас бы не хотел так сказать одним словом, потому что для этого, наверняка, нужно сделать социологические опросы. Но мы же маленькие государства: 3 миллиона в Литве, меньше чем 2 в Латвии и Эстонии. Вы же огромнейшая мировая держава, и думаю, что более такое понимание показано со стороны Москвы к этим странам. Меньше угроз и каких-то военных деклараций содействовало успокоению этих эмоций, которые опять-таки, не эмоции из-за эмоций, а люди волнуются из-за своей истории, из-за того, что происходит в соседних странах, в соседней Украине. Ю. БУДКИН: Наши слушатели как раз продолжают пытаться проводить аналогии, а я продолжаю пытаться просить вас это прокомментировать. Косово-Донбасс. Вы видите возможность аналогии? В. УШАЦКАС: Опять-таки не будем искать аналогии там, где её нет. Говоря о Донбассе, части украинской республики, то самое главное, чтобы деэскалировалась ситуация, что касается в сфере безопасности, и чтобы были выполнены минские соглашения. И самое главное, мы тоже высказываем и упрёки делаем в адрес Киева, когда они свою домашнюю работу не выполняют. Но когда начинают вводить валюту в Донбассе, когда раздаются документы, которые признаются Российской Федерацией, конечно, для киевлян, для украинцев создаётся впечатление, что дополнительная аннексия уже происходит. И это не служит тому, чтобы создать условия для полного выполнения минских соглашений. Ю. БУДКИН: Ну и последнее, возвращаясь к Евровидению. Если всё-таки на Украине будут проводить Евровидение, а русскую певицу туда не пустят, Евросоюз будет реагировать? В. УШАЦКАС: Опять-таки этот вопрос надо задавать Европейскому вещательному союзу. Насколько я знаю, он предложил российской участнице возможность выступления посредством спутниковой трансляции, но я надеюсь и желаю, что каким-то образом всё-таки эти песни звучали. Ю. БУДКИН: Вигаудас Ушацкас - посол Евросоюза в России. Это была программа «Умные парни». Я благодарю вас. Спасибо, приходите ещё. В. УШАЦКАС: Спасибо вам большое, «Говорит Москва». Интересно слушать.

A consortium of European space research interests, DEMOCRITOS is aimed at investigating the demonstration and future prototyping activities required to bring forward technologies for high power space transportation using nuclear electric propulsion (NEP). The Moscow workshop saw experts from Europe, Russia, Japan and Brazil exchange information, findings and presentations around the future of solar system exploration including the steps necessary to enable high power, high payload mass space transportation technologies for an international ‘High Power Space Transportation Program’ – calling the APOLLO or ISS of the 2020 th and beyond. These envisage: The next decades will bring new challenges for robotic and human exploration of our solar system. Experts believe that the development of high-power electric propulsion systems, using nuclear power sources, can significantly contribute to the implementation of deep space missions. The DEMOCRITOS project ( www.h2020-democritos.eu ) was a collaboration of European and Russian teams in the field of Nuclear Electric Propulsion. The consortium members were the European Science Foundation (ESF), the French Space Agency CNES (France), the Nuclear National Laboratory (NNL/UK), the German Space Agency DLR (Germany), the Keldysh Research Centre (Russia), Thales Alenia Space Italia (TASI/Italy) and Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL/France).

Supporting the future of Syria and the region: co-chairs declaration,05.04.2017,05.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24269_en,,"The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, the Emergency Relief Coordinator and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations and the Foreign Ministers of Germany, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar, and the United Kingdom chaired today in Brussels a conference on the Syrian conflict and its impact on the region. 1. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, the Emergency Relief Coordinator and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations and the Foreign Ministers of Germany, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar, and the United Kingdom chaired today in Brussels a conference on the Syrian conflict and its impact on the region. This conference brought together representatives of over 70 countries and international organisations, international and Syrian civil society, and built on previous years' conferences in Kuwait and London. 2. The conflict in Syria has brought about destruction and human suffering on an enormous scale. In particular, the Conference condemned the use of chemical weapons by the Government and ISIL/Daesh, as identified by the UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism, and the attacks on Khan Sheikhun yesterday. The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, must stop immediately. 3. The international community is deeply committed to engaging and working together to support a peaceful future for Syria and all its people. To that effect, the conference stressed the importance of maintaining a sovereign, independent, unitary and territorially integral country where all Syrians will be able to live in peace and security. It aimed at further progress towards a sustainable inclusive peace, while addressing the urgent humanitarian and resilience needs inside Syria and supporting the efforts of neighbouring countries in hosting over five million refugees. 4. The conference recognised that the humanitarian and resilience needs of vulnerable people (especially women and children) inside Syria and in the region have never been greater. It took note of UN-coordinated appeals requesting $8 billion in 2017 to cover assistance and protection needs inside Syria as well as in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. It acknowledged the continuing generosity of neighbouring host countries and their communities in providing refuge to millions of displaced people. Participants agreed that in order to meet the massive needs of populations inside Syria and in neighbouring countries and strengthen the resilience of host communities, significant financial support and innovative and holistic approaches are needed. The generosity of the participants has resulted in the pledging $ 6 billion (€ 5.6 billion) for 2017, as well as multi-year pledges of $ 3.73 billion (€ 3.47 billion) for 2018-2020. In addition, some international financial institutions and donors announced around $ 30 billion (€ 27.9 billion) in loans of which elements are on concessional terms. Co-chairs and others agreed to widen the resource base and ensure greater predictability, coherence and effectiveness of the aid by translating the Grand Bargain commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit into action to deliver concrete dividends for the people affected by the Syrian conflict. 5. Humanitarian assistance alone, however, cannot stop the suffering of Syria's people in the absence of a political solution negotiated between the Syrian parties, on the basis of relevant UNSCRs, including 2254, and the 2012 Geneva Communique. The conference highlighted that any lasting solution to the conflict has to be centred on meeting the democratic aspirations and needs of the Syrian people and providing safety and security for all. Only through a genuine and inclusive political transition will there be an end to the conflict. 6. Participants therefore re-iterated their full support and commitment to the UN-moderated intra-Syrian talks in Geneva, as the only forum where a political solution should be negotiated. They welcomed the talks in Geneva, looked forward to further progress, and commended the tireless efforts of the UN Special Envoy. The role for civil society, including women's organisations, was recognised as a key part of a lasting solution.  Participants explored how the international community and the region can contribute to ensuring the success of the talks. 7. Participants recognised the constructive role that regional actors can play in facilitating a resolution to the conflict and welcomed the initiative of the EU to find common ground between them on the future of Syria. 8. The Astana meetings have a potentially crucial role in consolidating and strengthening the nationwide ceasefire, guaranteed by Russia and Turkey, and, now, with the participation of Iran. Constructive contributions from the Astana meetings should complement the efforts of the Geneva Task Forces. While supporting these efforts, strong concerns were expressed about ongoing military activity and all sides were urged to redouble their efforts to achieve full compliance with the ceasefire. A genuine ceasefire should facilitate unimpeded, country-wide humanitarian access. Immediate practical measures such as the release of detainees/abductees, the exchange of prisoners and handover of bodies, to identify missing persons, were also recognised as important confidence building measures. Participants welcomed the UN's readiness to provide technical support to improve the efficiency of the trilateral mechanism to observe compliance with the ceasefire. 9. The protection of civilians remains paramount. Participants condemned the continued violations and abuses of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law by parties involved in the conflict, including the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, in particular medical and educational infrastructure and places of worship, and sexual and gender based violence. In particular they noted the findings of the UN Headquarters Board of Inquiry on the UN-Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy. In addition participants condemned the atrocities committed by ISIL/Daesh and other UN-designated terrorist groups and reaffirmed their strong commitment to defeat them. Co-chairs called for support, including through adequate financial means, for the implementation of the UNGA Resolution 71/248 establishing an International Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to ensure accountability for such systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of IHL and human rights in Syria. 10. Participants recalled the urgency of allowing rapid, safe, sustained and unhindered countrywide humanitarian access by UN agencies and NGOs to all those in need through the most direct routes, including across conflict lines and across borders, and to end all arbitrary denials of humanitarian access. Starvation of civilians through besiegement as a method of combat and their forcible displacement, as identified by the Commission of Inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council, are clear breaches of IHL, and as such, they are unacceptable and must cease immediately. Providing immediate humanitarian support and protection to all those in need throughout the country remains imperative. Participants praised the work of Syrian, regional and international aid organisations, and called on those responsible on the ground to ensure that humanitarian relief and medical workers can deliver assistance without facing the risk of violence. Humanitarian mine action to reduce the impact of explosive hazards in Syria was also recognised as a critical protection issue for civilians. Neighbouring countries were called upon to continue to facilitate humanitarian access. 11. Participants recognised the challenges faced by neighbouring countries, notably Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey due to the extended presence of millions of Syrian refugees, and commended those governments, together with Iraq, Egypt and others in the region including Gulf states hosting significant numbers of people from Syria, for providing leadership in responding to the impact of the conflict. Participants took note of the resolution of the League of Arab States on the Syrian refugee crisis and reaffirmed their strong commitment to support host countries in providing public services, protection and assistance to refugees and host communities. The conference paid particular tribute to all those who had delivered such support in the most difficult of circumstances. Substantial progress has been made by regional governments in meeting London Conference objectives and participants welcomed the generosity of the countries hosting refugees.12. The co-chairs and others acknowledged the need for support for the economic development of Jordan and Lebanon to address the impact of the protracted crisis as well as opportunities for Syrians to secure their livelihoods. They welcomed progress in opening labour markets to refugees and agreed to support job creation programmes aligned with the host country governments' social and economic development strategies. Bearing in mind the need to accelerate progress to create 1.1 million jobs, the co-chairs undertook to support economic growth for the benefit of all, including through access to external markets and concessional funding, as well as infrastructure development. The co-chairs called upon the other participants to join them in supporting the necessary reforms, which would include improved regulation and investment climate, strengthened public-private sector links and adoption of clear reform strategies. Participants committed to increasing access to vocational training for refugees and host communities, closely aligned with private sector labour needs and accompanied by skills matching programmes. Details of how we will pursue this shared vision are set out in the documents in annex. 13. Participants agreed to continue to work towards the target of ensuring No Lost Generation of children, in Syria and in the region and increase efforts to reach the goal of getting all refugee children and vulnerable children in host communities into quality education with equal access for girls and boys. They committed to increase access to learning for 1.75 million children out of school in Syria itself . In this regard, it was also agreed to centre efforts on improving learning outcomes for boys and girls from the refugee and vulnerable host communities and to prevent drop out due to financial and non-financial barriers. 14. Participants highlighted the close links between protection, education and livelihood opportunities and welcomed host countries' renewed commitment to the protection of refugees, including through addressing those factors that place them in a situation of illegality. Humanitarian assistance to support the basic needs of the most vulnerable refugees, with a specific emphasis on children and women, must be strengthened. Participants recognised the critical role of resettlement as a protection tool for particularly vulnerable refugees, in order to offer, together with other legal pathways, safe and dignified access to safety beyond the immediate region. The importance of safe, voluntary and dignified return of refugees, in accordance with international law and once conditions are in place, was recognised. 15. Reconstruction and international support for its implementation will be a peace dividend only once a credible political transition is firmly underway. It is vital that post-agreement planning progresses in order to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when the conditions outlined in the UNSCR 2254 and the Geneva Communiqué are in place. Participants therefore welcomed the work of the UN Inter-agency Task Force on UN post-agreement planning and its efforts to engage with relevant stakeholders and address international coordination, and took note of the principles for civilian stabilisation outlined at the London Conference. Damage and needs analyses are currently being undertaken by the UN, EU and World Bank, with a view to initiating a full Recovery and Peace Building Assessment when appropriate. Co-chairs and others reflected on ways in which Syrians and their neighbours could contribute to Syrian economic recovery and reconstruction once a credible political transition is firmly under way. 16. Participants acknowledged that reconstruction will be successful only in the context of a genuine and inclusive transition that benefits all the Syrians. The legitimate grievances and democratic aspirations of the Syrian people need to be addressed to secure lasting peace. Reconciliation and transitional justice will also be an integral part of rebuilding the country on a peaceful basis. 17. The attached fundraising annex sets out the pledges made at this Conference. The co-chairs committed to track and report on delivery of pledges, in coordination with the UN. They also undertook to review progress on the commitments of this conference regularly at key international events during the year. 18. Today's conference has agreed on a comprehensive approach to the Syrian crisis.  It underlined the need to continue to respond to the dire humanitarian situation by ensuring principled assistance and protection for those populations in need and support to the neighbouring countries. The scale of suffering is such that a political solution is more urgent than ever before. Investment of political efforts in supporting a resolution to the crisis is therefore paramount in securing a future for Syria and its people. Only Syrians can make the agreement that will secure peace. But the commitment of the international community and the region to supporting them in achieving that peaceful future is essential. Sustainable and inclusive peace in Syria for the Syrians remains the objective of all our efforts. Bruxelles"

This decision could lead to the liquidation of the Administrative Centre and all local branches of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia and the confiscation of their properties. In the meantime, the Ministry has labelled the Administrative Centre as ""extremist"" and imposed a nationwide ban on all legal entities of Jehovah's Witnesses. These are very negative developments, which could make it possible to launch criminal prosecutions against Jehovah's Witnesses for mere acts of worship. The European Union shares the concern of the UN Human Rights Committee about a number of reports indicating that the Federal Law on Combating Extremist Activity is increasingly used in the Russian Federation to curtail freedom of religion, targeting, inter alia, Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Remarks by  Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference of the Brussels Conference ‘Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region’,05.04.2017,05.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24245_en,,"Remarks by High Representative / Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference of the Brussels Conference ‘Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region’ Check against delivery!  I would like to thank all my friends and co-chairs for having prepared this Conference and started this Conference this morning together with a collective effort, together with the Emergency Relief Coordinator and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations [Stephen O'Brien] and the Foreign Ministers of Germany [Sigmar Gabriel], Kuwait [Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Hamad Al Sabah], Norway [Børge Brende], Qatar [Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman] and the United Kingdom [Boris Johnson]. I chaired today in Brussels this Conference on “Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region”. We brought together representatives of over 70 countries and international organisations, international and Syrian civil society and built on previous years’ Conferences in Kuwait and London. The unity of the international community is today more not less relevant than ever and our common work is more not less urgent today, to bring humanitarian aid to Syrians and to put an end to the war. The conflict in Syria has brought about destruction and human suffering on an enormous scale. In particular, the Conference condemned the use of chemical weapons by the government and Da’esh, as identified by the UN-OPCW [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] Joint Investigative Mechanism and the attacks on Khan Sheikhun yesterday. The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, must stop immediately. The international community is committed – today recommits – to working together to support a peaceful future for Syria and all Syrians in a sovereign, independent, unitary and territorially integral country where all Syrians will be able to live in peace and security. We committed to work for a sustainable inclusive peace while addressing the urgent humanitarian needs inside Syria and supporting the work for neighbouring countries in hosting over five million refugees. The Conference recognised that humanitarian needs of vulnerable people, especially women and children, inside Syria and in the region were never so great. We decided to respond to this humanitarian crisis, in particularly in response to the UN appeals - and Stephen O'Brien will for sure be happy to give you more details on this particular issue following your questions-. But we all agreed that it is important to ensure not only humanitarian support is available, but that it can be delivered.  Access for this aid throughout the country has to be improved and sieges and starvation tactics have to stop. Humanitarian assistance alone, however, cannot stop the war, cannot stop the suffering of Syria's people. What Syrians need and want is a political solution negotiated between the Syrian parties, on the basis of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including 2254 and the 2012 Geneva Communiqué. The Conference highlighted clearly that any lasting solution to the conflict has to be centred on meeting the democratic aspirations and needs of the Syrian people and providing safety and security for all Syrians. Only through a genuine and inclusive political transition will there be an end to the conflict. We, therefore, gave our full support to the Geneva peace talks and commended and encouraged the excellent work of the UN Special Envoy [for Syria] Staffan de Mistura. We also stressed the role of civil society, including women's organisations that was recognised as a key part of a lasting solution. More attention was given also to the importance of achieving full compliance with the ceasefire agreed at the Astana meetings and we recognised a special and important role and responsibility that the three guarantors hold when it comes to its full implementation – meaning Russia, Turkey and now Iran. More needs also to be done to protect civilians and relief workers in this terrible conflict. There must be no doubt that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law or human rights, whoever they are – whoever they are - will be held accountable. In particular, we condemn, as I said, the use of chemical weapons, as reported in yesterday's attack, and demand that they cease and that accountability is guaranteed through the appropriate mechanisms. The third theme of our Conference was a recognition of the important role played by the neighbouring countries – as you know the Conference focussed also on the future of the region –, especially Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. We have agreed documents setting out mutual commitments between Lebanon and Jordan and the international community. These countries need our continued support and they will continue to get it. Today we agreed on this all together. In particular we need to support the economic development of neighbouring countries to address the impact of the protracted crisis as well as opportunities for Syrians to secure their livelihoods. We need to increase our work to reach the goal of getting all refugee children, vulnerable children in host communities and children in Syria into quality education. No lost generation can be accepted. Practical steps were agreed today to make this happen. Finally – the fourth theme – we highlighted that reconstruction and international support for its implementation would be a peace dividend -a very powerful one - but only once a credible and inclusive political transition is firmly underway.  We heard from representatives of civil society inside Syria, who contributed with their personal testimony – sometimes very moving ones - and also with very practical and political ideas that indicated us the way on how we can act to help the people of Syria. Today’s Conference has agreed on a holistic approach to the Syrian crisis. The urgent needs we need to face continue to respond to the dire humanitarian situation by ensuring assistance and protection for those in need and support to the countries in the region. The scale of suffering is such that a political solution is more urgent than ever before. Investment of political work in supporting a resolution to the crisis is key in securing a future, any future, but especially a free and democratic future for Syria and its people. Only Syrians can make the agreement that will secure peace. But the commitment of the international community and the region - that today we have taken-  is supporting them in achieving that a peaceful future is essential and today we stated this. Sustainable and inclusive peace in Syria for the Syrians remains the objective of all our common work. That has not always been an easy meeting today but it has been, I think, a constructive one. I thank you very much and I will invite my colleagues to answer to your questions unless you have any specific questions particularly directed to me.  Q. If Raqqa falls, it will not necessary fall into the hands of [the President of Syria, Bashar al-]Assad and how will it play into the international cooperation to try to solve and make any political progress and find a root to any peace in Syria? Just one word on this because, as Børge [Brende, Foreign Minister of Norway] rightly mentioned, there is a military strategy of the [U.S.-led] Anti-Da’esh Coalition – we discussed this a few weeks ago in Washington -. There is together with it the humanitarian component and I would like to stress one unequivocal principle: as we underline that reconstruction and support to the reconstruction from the international community is linked to the beginning of a political transition, humanitarian assistance and help is always unconditional and goes to every human being in need. But, then, there is a political component and there is not going to be any military strategy that can substitute a true political solution. And this is going to be true all over Syria because what we heard today from the Syrian friends who addressed our ministerial meeting with powerful words, what is needed is a political situation in the country, governance in the country, that will allow each and every Syrian to feel home in Syria. Unless this happens, there will not be any sustainable peace and no sustainable social and human reconstruction of the country far before the economic one. So I think this is clear. We have three components of the work to be done: the military one against Da’esh, the military efforts to bring the ‘hudna’, the ceasefire, into place, for real and the humanitarian and political work. These are all components of the same work. And today even in very difficult conditions, I believe, we witnessed a moment of a serious, frank, but constructive and unified purpose, more than I expected. I hope and I believe – I expect, as we say in diplomatic terms – that the consistency of all the actors at the table will be proven in the coming hours on all these different elements; the military dynamics on the ground, the humanitarian delivery and the political efforts. Just one second, just to remind you all on the numbers, but also on the co-chairs declaration. We will release it exactly at the end of the conference day, so there you will have the final common pledge, but also the resume – somehow - of the co-chairs declaration getting the inputs of the interventions today. Thank you. Bruxelles"
Opening statement by  Federica Mogherini at the Brussels Conference “Supporting the future of Syria and the Region”,05.04.2017,05.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24204_en,,"Opening statement by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the Brussels Conference “Supporting the future of Syria and the Region” Check against delivery! Welcome to Brussels for this important international conference. First of all let me particularly welcome Secretary General [of the United Nations], António Guterres, also the Prime Ministers of Lebanon, Mr [Saad] Al-Hariri, and Jordan Mr [Hani] Al-Mulki, and my fellow co-chairs, the Foreign Ministers [Foreign Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman] Al-Thani, [Foreign Minister of Norway, Børge] Brende, [First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Hamad] Al-Sabah, [Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor of Germany, Sigmar] Gabriel and [United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris] Johnson, and all of you representing so many countries and international organisations here today. And let me start by saying that, indeed, today and yesterday are sad days – as there have been hundreds and thousands of days that have been sad, dramatic, horrific, in these last six years. How many minutes of silence we have observed in these six years and how much frustration we have all felt in front of the victims - the children, the innocent people losing their lives. This is a conference where all of us come together, as international community, to tell the Syrian people that we care for their lives and that we are ready to support the livings, the ones who are still alive, and prevent the lives of those who are at risk inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries. But this is also, I think, a conference where our voice can join the voice of so many Syrians, as the civil society representatives that we will hear in a few minutes. All the Syrian women and men that have only one word to say to us: ""Hudna"" – a ceasefire and peace. And I think we have also a collective responsibility as international community to be consistent, not only with our humanitarian efforts, but also with our political work, to make sure that peace can be reached in the country with the help and the support of all of us. We have a responsibility to put an end to this war. We are here in Brussels today with clear purposes and clear reasons. First of all, giving an answer to these Syrians who still hope and believe that peace can be built in their country. Every time I meet with representatives of Syrian civil society – and especially the women if I can say so – I see this mix of desperation and hope. And if they still have hope, I think we have a duty to live up to these expectations to be able to rebuild their own country in freedom, in democracy, in full respect of human lives and rights. The first thing we have today is obviously condemning all loss of lives and particularly the horrific chemical attack close to Idlib that was yet another reminder – if we needed it any – of the need for us to come together and put an end to this war. Some in our public opinions might think that the humanitarian effort in this moment is a naive exercise. Ask to the millions of Syrians who live thanks to that humanitarian aid, thanks to that humanitarian support that we are mobilising here and you will realised that this is a must; it is not a naive exercise. It is where peace can be built. First objective of our work today is this: support the Syrians, inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries and help the living. The people in need – including the most vulnerable, children, women – cannot wait until the war is solved, ended and everything is settled. They need our help right now. So we must look at the commitments we made in London [ The Supporting Syria and the Region conference ] last year, assess where we have made progress and where progress has been too slow. We must look at the needs for 2017 and raise the necessary funding through our pledges today. And we will look forward to 2018 and 2019 to ensure that we can provide some continuity and predictability to the humanitarian support we give to Syrians. Here in this room I think we have to be very clear on the fact that we are supporting the Syrians and we are supporting them as they hope to build the future of their country. The European Union has fulfilled its pledge for 2016. We are always the ones that not only pledge but also deliver on our pledge. I can today announce we will also deliver on our pledge for 2017. We are and we will continue to be the first humanitarian donor, the strongest supporter of the people of Syria and of their host countries. Today we commit to maintain similar levels of support, amounting to €560 million for 2018 for Lebanon, Jordan and for the humanitarian work inside Syria and we have the ambition to maintain our level of engagement also in 2019. What is vital is that humanitarian funding – this humanitarian funding - turns into humanitarian action. And for this to happen, for this money to become something real to the Syrian people and to the hosting communities, we need not only the energy, the passion, the dedication of the humanitarian workers that put sometimes their lives at risk but also we need to make sure that full access throughout Syria is guaranteed to humanitarian access. Second objective of this conference is to support the region and to support the future of the region. This is why I am particularly glad to have next to me, the Prime Minister of Jordan [Hani Al-Mulki], the Prime Minister of Lebanon [Saad Al-Hariri], but also representatives of countries like Iraq or Egypt that are hosting in the region a large number of Syrians. Because the story of the Syrian conflict is the story that affects the entire region and the broader region including Europe, but it is also the story of generosity and solidarity. We cannot just praise the solidarity or commend the solidarity. We have a responsibility to support those who are showing solidarity and make it sustainable in the long term. The people of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey deserve all our support, as well as those in Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere who are hosting thousands of Syrian refugees. It is a promise we made in London and we continue to honor our promise. More than half of the overall pledge from the London Conference came from the European Union and our Member States and we have fully delivered on our commitments both financially and through the compacts with Lebanon and Jordan. On top of the humanitarian aid, we are promoting economic growth and jobs for our Lebanese and Jordanian friends, as well as for the refugees because we do not want to see a conflict between the hosting communities and the refugees who are hosted by these communities. Third objective: make peace possible. Here we are more than 70 countries and organisations. The world is looking at us, the Syrians are looking at us and are expecting us to give a strong push to the political talks in Geneva under the excellent leadership of the UN and the Special Envoy [for Syria, Staffan de Mistura], because it is clear that the best investment for all the people of Syria and for a sustainable future in the region is a commitment to peace – serious, consistent commitment to peace. The task undertaken in Astana by Russia, Turkey and now Iran, is important, is increasingly urgent - the attack in Idlib makes it even more evident. A mechanism for an implementation of the ceasefire has to be a serious one and we have to put a halt to the continuing breaches committed on a daily basis, some more dramatic than others but the ceasefire is a must. Hudna, hudna, hudna! It also needs a political horizon if it has to be sustainable and you will hear the civil society representatives – they met here in Brussels for four days, we met them yesterday -, they make this point very clear. The people of Syria need progress at the talks in Geneva, they want their country back, they want peace back. We need to have the talks in Geneva moving towards an inclusive credible political transition that builds on UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and on the 2012 Geneva Communiqué. And I will go even further: only a political solution to the conflict in Syria will allow for a real defeat of Da'esh, Al-Nusra, Al-Qa'ida and all the UN-designated terrorist groups in Syria. Only a political solution will allow all Syrians to return home without fear of arbitrary detention, torture, executions and child recruitments. Only a political transition can make all Syrians feel home in their own country and be part of a joint effort to give a rebirth to the country. It is up to the Syrian parties to reach a political agreement and shape the future of their country. But we can collectively contribute to creating the space for them to engage in peace, with political pressure and with the right incentives. We will hear in the political session the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura on the progress made in the latest round of talks in Geneva. We will also hear from him the latest difficulties and the ways in which we can support his work for real. All of us, I think, have a responsibility to contribute to a successful outcome of the talks in Geneva. And I want to be very frank: this is the most complex and the most violent conflict in our times. No regional, no global power has the strength to solve it alone. We see many who attempt to worsen it by the day. This will only make the situation worse, not only for the Syrians, but also for the rest of the world. No side can impose one solution on the other. Peace in Syria will require an agreement among local players, but also support from all regional actors and world powers under the auspices of the United Nations. We, the European Union, are eager to do our part. We have been engaging with the regional actors, all of them, international powers and we believe that there is common ground, but we need serious political will from all. Fourth objective for today’s meeting – and I will close: supporting the future of Syria and of the region. Today, in Brussels, we can begin to work on one more contribution we can make to make peace possible. Once an agreement is reached, and only once an agreement is reached in Geneva, the reconstruction of Syria will require a massive collective effort. So it is crucial that the international community starts to get ready for that. Too many times we were unprepared to peace and we did not win the peace even after the conflict was over. We have to start preparing for that day even if today in particular that day seems very far away. It can also be a very strong incentives for the parties and for some regional and international players to see that there is a peace dividend for all the people of Syria, all of them, without any distinction or discrimination, to see that the international community – the European Union for sure – is ready to help them reconstruct and rebuild the future of their country, on the basis of the end of violence and of a political transition that starts. The future of Syria belongs to Syrians. We all agree on that. Peace and reconciliation is in their hands – has to be in their hands. But today we can send a powerful message to our Syrian friends - women, men, children - :  We are on your side, on the side of the Syrian people who are suffering; we are helping you already, we are ready to help you more for a free, united, inclusive, democratic Syria. Thank you. Bruxelles"
"Remarks by Federica Mogherini with the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Mr Staffan de Mistura",04.04.2017,04.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24160_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative / Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press point with the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Mr Staffan de Mistura, following a meeting of civil society ahead of the Brussels Conference 'Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region' We just met with brave women and men who are engaged in civil society work inside Syria and outside Syria - all Syrians different background, different ages, different political ideas. This morning and today all saddened together with us by the news of a horrible attack in Idlib – chemical weapons as the worst of the war crimes - and whoever is responsible for that must be held accountable. We have talked about that with the representatives of civil society and not one single of them fails to mention the need to work on accountability and responsibility. If I can pass the message that we share with them is that impunity is not an option, especially in front of these terrible scenes we are seeing today. And maybe it is not by chance that it is exactly when the international community, 70 different countries and organisations come together to try and build peace, supporting the UN [United Nations] mediation in Geneva, gathering funds for the humanitarian support and looking at the future and how the international community can support the Syrians as they build the future of Syria. Maybe it is not a chance that it is right in a moment like this that such attacks come. But we have the responsibility together with our Syrian friends to stay strong and continue working for peace. This is what they do. I am always impressed by the strength, the hope, the capacity to look at the future and to unite, that Syrian people show. Beyond the people that represent them even in the talks, I leave that to Staffan [de Mistura, UN Special Envoy for Syria], whenever I meet Syrians - women and men - they acknowledge their differences but they manage to look together at what they can do for the future of their country. And here today we heard the strong determination of all of them. First of all, to build together the future of Syria, take it in their hands; refuse violence of any kind; and guarantee that the future of Syria respects diversity and unity. And I think this is the basis of common sense but also the heart that the Syrian people express today, and tomorrow at the conference [Brussels Conference ""Supporting the future of Syria and the region""] together with the United Nations and - as I said - 70 different delegations from around the world and international organisations, we'll try to give an answer to this. Try to do their part of our responsibility, supporting the Syrians to try and find their way to their own future; with the humanitarian help, with the support to the political negotiations in Geneva that are for us the only way forward and also starting to look at what the international community can do in the future to reconstruct the country that will need to be reconstructed – not only from a material point of view but also  - that is self-evident - from a point of view of living together and rebuilding trust and the capacity to look at each other without hate in each other's eyes. From what I have seen the people of Syria are ready, the international community is ready; I hope that this political solution can be found or at least started so that we can all offer a dignified present and future for all Syrians inside and outside of Syria. And I did not mention how great it is to work as always not only with the United Nations. The European Union and the United Nations are more and more natural partners in this difficult war, but also with Staffan de Mistura [UN Special Envoy for Syria] who is doing a remarkable job as the UN Secretary General Special Envoy with patience, determination, diplomatic capacity that very few have in the world of today and finding or trying to find some common ground even where it seems impossible. I think we all owe him a lot in these difficult times and tomorrow I will be honoured to open the conference together with the Secretary General [of the United Nations], António Guterres. Q. [Inaudible] Do you have evidence of today's chemical attack in Syria? And in terms of reconstruction, why should not Russia and Iran pick up the bill since they have been doing much of the destroy? I would like also to pick up on this by saying that we also do not have any evidence at the moment and obviously the European Union and the United Nations and the entire international community especially as we gather here in these days on Syria, we share whatever we can share in terms of information. But I mentioned earlier this morning a principle that I would like to reiterate that there is an objective responsibility for any regime towards the protection of their own civilians and this is a principle that is valid under international law in any case and so I think this is something we have to remind us all and that also we discussed with our Syrian friends today. When it comes to the reconstruction, I want to make it very clear. The work that the European Union has started today at the technical level together with the United Nations and the international financial institutions is to start preparations for a major collective effort that will be needed in the moment when the conflict will be over and a political agreement will be reached. No reconstruction will be financed before that. Obviously all the humanitarian aid and all the humanitarian support will continue to come in. That is a must for us and as you know the European Union is the first humanitarian donor for Syria with almost €10 billion we have mobilised together with our Member States so far. That will continue, that is a priority for us. But the reconstruction effort, the reconstruction financing, will only be starting when the political process will start and an agreement will be reached in Geneva. Why do we need or do we believe there will be the need for a major international coordinated effort? Because the amounts of money we are talking about are amounts of money that no single power alone, not to mention powers as the ones you mentioned like Iran and Russia that do not have the strongest possible economy in the world, would ever have the resources to face. We as Europeans, as well as we believe the international community as such, have learned from our lessons in the past that you can win the war, but you can lose the peace and that is best recipe for a protracted state of confusion, tension, sometimes insecurity and conflict again. The cycle of falling back again into conflict if you do not stabilise the place after the conflict is over is very high. We do not have any interest in seeing that happening, obviously we do not imagine in any possible way that there can be a situation where the European Union takes the bill regardless of any kind of political dynamic. This is simply not going to happen and I think we made it very clear yesterday with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Union. But the Syrians have to know, and also the negotiating parties have to know in Geneva, and also the international players have to know that the European Union is ready to come and do its part, as always, provided that the political conditions are there, because we care about the Syrian people. That is our message. We Europeans are not the ones who are bombing, we are not the ones who are fighting, we are not the ones who are fighting, we are not the ones who are pushing for one side or the other – we are the ones delivering humanitarian aid, helping the UN to reach an agreement and a political solution, and we are the ones getting ready to help the Syrians build by themselves, as they would like to do, the future of their country. This is our approach; this is the way we believe foreign policy should be done and we are consistent on that. But this does not mean that somebody breaks everything and then we pay the bill – this is simply not going to happen. Q. Una domanda in italiano per l'Alto Commissario Mogherini - dopo il bombardamento di questa mattina aumenterà la pressione dell'Unione Europea sul regime di Bashar Al-Assad per la soluzione soprattutto diplomatica? L'Unione Europea ha sempre detto insieme alle Nazione Unite che non c'è altra soluzione a questo conflitto se non un accordo politico, che sta alle parti siriane trovare a Ginevra sotto l'egida delle Nazione Unite con il grande lavoro che sta facendo Staffan de Mistura. L'Unione Europea fa e continua a fare pressione per questo e al tempo stesso continuiamo a sostenere i siriani dentro la Siria e al di fuori della Siria per evitare che persone muoiano e continuino a morire in condizione drammatiche. E quindi per questo l'Unione Europea continua ad essere il primo donatore di aiuto umanitario per i siriani. [Translation from Italian] The European Union along with the United Nations have always said that there is no other solution to this conflict but a political agreement, which has to be found by Syrian parties in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations with the great work Staffan de Mistura is doing. The European Union is doing and will continue to advocate for this and at the same time we continue to support the Syrians inside Syria and outside Syria, so that people do not die, and do not continue to die in tragic conditions. So this is why the European Union remains the biggest donor of humanitarian aid for Syrians. Q. Mr de Mistura, during Geneva IV last February, we get by the end of the session a kind of hope that they agreed at least on four baskets and they are coming back. But in Geneva V things were again blocked. Why was the process blocked in this session of last week? And Mme Mogherini, don't you think that the blockade of the negotiation in Geneva - one can say the failure of the political process until now - can impact negatively the Conference? We thought in the beginning it will be a highly political one and it could be only a humanitarian Conference. I totally share what Staffan [de Mistura, UN Special Envoy for Syria] has just said. So the first part of your question is something I would put into question. I believe that it would be completely naïve to imagine that a round of talks in Geneva, being in the fourth or the fifth - or even the sixth probably - could bring the result of an end of the conflict. And I think it was not the expectation of the negotiator himself, of all of us, or of the parties that were coming together – if I am not wrong for the first times coming together even around the same table, or at least in the same room. After the seven years of war, you cannot expect one round of talks or two rounds of talks to bring the solution to everything, as you cannot expect a Conference [Brussels Conference ""Supporting the future of Syria and the region""] – even such an important Conference as the one we are having today and tomorrow here – to bring the end to the conflict but I would like to remember us all that we have finally entered the phase where content is discussed. Again, if it is not your role, it is for sure not mine that of giving details, but for once we have started  - and the parties have started - to discuss seriously about the content and this is something that was never achieved before. And the meaning of the Conference [Brussels Conference ""Supporting the future of Syria and the region""] here, as you mentioned, is not only that of keeping the humanitarian support high, because we also run the risk that the international community gets used to the Syrian crisis and this becomes a forgotten crisis. This is something we absolutely do not want to happen. But also, we are gathering 70 countries and organisations tomorrow exactly to pass this message of hope to the Syrian people and of encouragement - let’s say so - to the Syrian negotiating parties that the international community is strongly behind this process and has expectations on an outcome of this. It might not be tomorrow, it might not be the day after tomorrow, but once they entered the serious discussion on content we are on the right track. Thank you. Bruxelles"
Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the Foreign Affairs Council,03.04.2017,03.04.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/24066_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council I would like to start with the obvious fact that we have been following in the last hour the news coming from Saint Petersburg, together with the Foreign Ministers of all the EU Member States. Our condolences go to all Russian people and, in particular, to those who lost their loved ones and we continue to follow the news coming from Saint Petersburg with a lot of apprehension. As we will receive more details, we will be more precise also in our reaction but I expressed my condolences also to the Foreign Minister [of Russia, Sergey] Lavrov in a message we sent him. In the [Foreign Affairs] Council today, we adopted important decisions. First of all on Syria, as we will host the Syria Conference [Brussels Conference ""Supporting the future of Syria and the region""] tomorrow and the day after tomorrow in Brussels. We have adopted a European Union Common Strategy on Syria. You will find it well defined on paper, focusing on 6 major objectives that the European Union will put at the centre of its work. We find it is essential for the international community to keep focused on the situation in Syria. We have, as we enter in the seventh year of the conflict, 13.5 million Syrians in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria including 6.3 million Syrians internally displaced and an additional 5 million Syrian refugees hosted in the wider region. This requires not only humanitarian support, which is something that we hope the international community will commit to the day after tomorrow in Brussels. On our side we will continue to be the major humanitarian donor for Syrians. The situation also requires the international community to unite, to facilitate a political solution to the conflict. For the European Union, it is essential, first of all, to find a framework to ensure a genuine political transition, supporting the work of the UN Special Envoy [for Syria] Staffan de Mistura. The Conference the day after tomorrow will focus also on supporting the Geneva talks and his work. I talked to Staffan [de Mistura] this morning and we shared some considerations on how to proceed on the political transition and on the solution to the conflict. Second: promoting a meaningful and inclusive transition in Syria. This means also creating space for all the Syrian people, including all different backgrounds, including civil society, including women and obviously the Syrian opposition in whatever kind of solution and agreement can be found. Third: saving lives by addressing the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable Syrians across the country. This, as I said, is the field where the European Union has been consistent and will continue to be, but we do not want to be the only ones not only pledging but also delivering on the pledges. This is why in the Conference we will assess where we are on the commitments we all made in London last year and see where we need to fill the gaps. Fourth: promoting democracy, human rights and freedom of speech by strengthening Syrian Civil Society Organisations. As you might know, the European Union has been working constantly with Syrians of all backgrounds in the last years and we will continue to do so. Fifth point, that is very important to us and to all Member States and that was re-stressed today: the need to promote accountability for war crimes with a view to facilitating a national reconciliation process and transitional justice. This is something on which we believe the future of Syria can be based. And, last but not least, supporting the resilience of the Syrian population and of the Syrian society. This includes some preparation work that we will start together with the UN system and with the international financial institutions, on the bigger picture of how the international community gets ready to support the reconstruction, the reconciliation and the stabilisation of the country in the moment when a political agreement is found to pave the way to the transition. This will be addressed at the Conference, and we discussed this with the ministers and how to support the region at large, in particular Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. We will work with them on the follow-up of [2016] London [‘Supporting Syria and the Region’ Conference]. In particular we have the EU-Turkey Statement, but also and mainly, I would say, the compacts that we have developed with Jordan and Lebanon. We will assess together with the Prime Ministers of Jordan and Lebanon our support to these two countries that are key and the way forward to this. But also our support to Egypt and Iraq, other two countries that are highly affected by the Syrian crisis and this will be an opportunity for the entire international community to give a strong support to the entire region. But, again, let me stress: humanitarian sustained support; full engagement in supporting the UN work in Geneva – the political talks; starting to prepare for the reconstruction that will have to be ready but will come only when a political transition and a political agreement will be in place. We also adopted important decisions and conclusions on Yemen, in which the European Union, first of all, points to the fact that this cannot become a forgotten crisis. It is entering its third year. It is politically entering into a stalemate that we cannot afford to take place, first of all, because we have 17 million citizens there who are aid dependent, out of which 7 million are in the brink of famine. This can have very serious humanitarian consequences, but also security consequences that are very serious for the entire region, spreading to the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa. This affects broader stability and security implication that we are trying to tackle. The European Union is, also in this crisis, a major humanitarian donor but we are also facilitating some talks and some efforts to resume negotiations. We have decided to increase not only our humanitarian but also political and diplomatic work to try and bring an end to this conflict. We also exchanged views on Libya. I updated the Ministers on the latest developments and, in particular, on the establishment of the Quartet on Libya where the European Union joined the Arab League, the African Union and the UN in trying to bring the Libyans together - East and West - within the Libyan Political Agreement. It is a pure illusion, and a dangerous illusion, to think that one part can rule over the entire country against the other. What is needed is really for all Libyans to come together and we believe that working together with other regional organisations, in particular with the Arab League and the African Union and obviously with the United Nations, can help the Libyans to come together themselves. We also went through the latest developments when it comes to security in Libya. When it comes to the situation in the Oil Crescent, stressing the need to preserve the oil infrastructure for all Libyans and preventing illegal oil sales outside the official channels and circuits, the NOC ( National Oil Company) and the Central Bank and also on one aspect - that is not the central and the only aspect with which we deal with when we discuss about Libya - meaning the migration one. We went through the implementation of the Malta decisions and, in particular, commented on the agreement that also the southern tribes of Libya signed recently - I think at the end of last week - to agree among themselves about better management of the southern borders, among themselves, to fight traffickers. I think that we shared the approach that these developments need our encouragement and support and this is something we will guarantee. As well as we are glad to see that the IOM [International Organisation for Migration] is restarting its work in the country and we are fully supporting them in this effort. We finished our agenda today with a long and very productive exchange with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul Gheit. I met him just last week in Jordan where he kindly invited me to address the opening of the [28 th ] Summit of the Arab League. We have been working very closely together in the last months, at the meeting of the Quartet on Libya in Cairo, and at the meeting of the Arab League and the European Union’s Foreign Ministers at the end of December. We have a communality of approaches and policies when it comes to the Middle East Peace Process, when it comes to several of the regional crises. We also discussed the preparations of the Brussels Conference [""Supporting the future of Syria and the region""] and we have decided to continue to work together very closely, coordinating as much as possible our positions and steps, including starting to work on holding of the first Summit between the European Union and the League of Arab States. That was first decided in our ministerial meeting in Cairo in December and then confirmed at the Summit in Jordan last week, so we will start preparations for that in the coming weeks. I'll stop here and I am ready for your questions.  Q: On no information from Turkey if they will send a representative to the Conference on Syria [""Supporting the future of Syria and the region""]. The tensions have been high between Turkey and several European countries lately over the campaigning in European countries on the referendum, is this linked? What is the explanation you get? Do you have information about Turkey sending anyone or not to the Conference and what do you think, what do you expect from the Turkish side? Thank you. The invitation is open at the level of Prime Minister. As I said, the three Prime Ministers of the countries that are most affected by the Syrian crisis, being Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, have been invited to the Conference. We know that both Lebanon and Jordan are coming at the level of Prime Ministers with large ministerial delegations. On the Turkish side there is, at the moment, no confirmation. The invitation is always open. I would not link this to tensions, also because contacts with the Turkish authorities are ongoing and continue to be constructive on the Syria file. I assume that the decision will be mainly linked to the internal political agenda that is particularly intense, I imagine, in view of the upcoming referendum - it is only in ten days from now. So, obviously that will be a choice for the Turkish authorities, not for me to answer on that, but I would rule out tensions on Syria with Turkey, on which we are continuing to work well. Q. Sur le Sommet UE-Ligue Arabe, savez-vous déjà quand il pourrait avoir lieu? Sur le Yémen, quand vous entendez développer les pressions politiques et diplomatiques pour une solution, pouvez-vous un peu expliquer? Avez-vous discuté avec les Etats membres du problème de la livraison d'armes à l'Arabie Saoudite qui pourraient ensuite se retrouver au Yémen? Ce dernier point n'a pas été discuté aujourd'hui au Conseil. Sur le niveau du travail diplomatique et politique pour essayer de trouver une solution politique à la crise, il s'agit de faciliter surtout un travail, c’est-à-dire des efforts pour faciliter des rencontres qui puissent après faciliter des négociations officielles, en soutenant les approches qui sont déjà sur la table, surtout de la part de l'Envoyé Spécial des Nations Unies avec les acteurs régionaux qui ne sont pas seulement les acteurs du Golfe mais aussi les acteurs de la Corne de l'Afrique et de la région au large, c'est-à-dire aussi de la Ligue Arabe. L'Union Européenne n'est pas seulement un donateur principal mais aussi un acteur qui a la confiance des différents acteurs régionaux qui sont impliqués dans le conflit et cela nous donne une possibilité de faciliter peut-être un terrain d’entente que l'on peut trouver pour trouver une solution non-militaire à la crise. Pour le Sommet Union européenne - Ligue Arabe, on va commencer les préparations, y compris la définition d'une possible date. On est maintenant en avril déjà, j'imagine que ça va être plutôt vers le début de l'année prochaine mais on pourra être plus précis sur cela dans quelques semaines. Q. What is the European Union position on Gibraltar? Clearly, you named it in the Donald Tusk’s guidelines issued earlier on this week. Is the European Union siding with Spain in this issue? Sorry, it is not a Foreign Policy issue yet. Bruxelles"

HRC 34 - EU Intervention: Interactive Dialogue on the High Commissioner oral update on Ukraine,22.03.2017,22.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/23253_en,,"34th Session of the Human Rights Council Geneva, 27 February – 24 March 2017 EU Intervention:  Interactive Dialogue on the High Commissioner oral update on Ukraine Mr. President, The European Union would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General for his important update on the situation in Ukraine. The EU is concerned about the spike in hostilities as documented by the 17 th report of the OHCHR Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The escalation of the conflict caused critical damage to civilian infrastructure and deprived tens of thousands of people of life-saving services and basic necessities. The EU is concerned about the high number of conflict-related civilian casualties as well as high number of ceasefire violations. It is crucial that all parties fully respect and implement their obligations under the Minsk Agreements as a first step towards a sustainable political solution that is based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence. We underline Russia’s responsibility in this regard and once again call on Russia to use its considerable influence over the separatists it backs to meet these commitments in full. We consider a permanent ceasefire as an essential precondition for all moves towards consolidated peace. We strongly support the valuable work of the OHCHR Mission which brings impartial information on the situation on the ground. We are concerned about reported persistent patterns of human rights violations and abuses, especially with regards to rights to life, liberty, security and physical integrity. We stress the crucial role of documentation of past and recent cases of enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture and ill treatment for the purpose of future accountability. We are alarmed by the patterns of sexual violence committed in the context of the conflict in the east, as documented by the recent thematic report and urge all parties to implement its recommendations. The 18 th March marked the third anniversary of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by the Russian Federation. The European Union reiterates that it does not recognise and continues to condemn this violation of international law as well as remaining committed to fully implementing its non-recognition policy, including through restrictive measures. The EU is following with great concern the ongoing deterioration of the human rights situation on the peninsula since its illegal annexation. Systematic human rights violations, including cases of abusive treatment of detainees, confessions obtained through torture and ill-treatment by the authorities, as well as imposed psychiatric internment on certain individuals and interference in the professional activities of defence lawyers are of great concern. Furthermore, the continuous persecution and violations of the rights of the Crimean Tatars and of persons belonging to Ukrainian speaking communities must come to an end, and the decision to prohibit Mejlis of Crimean Tatars must be revoked. The EU calls on all sides of the conflict to respect international human rights and humanitarian law and in this context we stress that all international human rights observers should be granted full, free and unhindered access to the territories of eastern Ukraine not controlled by government and illegally annexed Crimea, as laid out in resolution 71/205 on the Situation of human rights in Crimea/Sevastopol, adopted by the UN General Assembly We stress the need to fully implement the UN General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine and recommendations contained in the OHCHR Mission's reports. Mr Assistant Secretary-General, What concrete measures could be taken to address the negative impact on life saving services of the increased attacks on critical infrastructure? What concrete measures in your opinion could be taken to better protect the rights of individuals belonging to ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities? Thank you. Geneva"
High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Carnegie Nuclear Policy Conference,20.03.2017,20.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/23056_en,,"Speech by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Carnegie Nuclear Policy Conference  Check against delivery!  Let me thank you, Bill [ William Burns, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace], and let me thank Carnegie and all of you for being here, and for this invitation. You know how much I care about non-proliferation and nuclear policy: even before I chaired the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program, before I was High Representative or Minister, I was already engaged with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO), and the broader global non-proliferation community. And I see so many friends here today I am really please to meet again. Not only are so many of you here in the room, I also see the non-proliferation work done – a work that is key this moment. It is a life-time commitment, but in this precise moment, it is even more important to discuss nuclear policies, and to preserve the rules that were agreed in recent decades through so much hard work, vision and courage. So I’m particularly glad to be here with you today, for at least two reasons. One, that we really need the expert community to be part of the conversation with policy-makers, to explain what the current rules have achieved, what we still have to build, and why it is so important to strengthen and preserve the global non-proliferation architecture. Second, because we can never stop looking at the way forward, as new challenges arise – as Bill was mentioning -, at the new tools we can develop, and the potential impact of any new agreement. The European Union organises every year a “Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Conference” precisely for this reason. So it is just natural for me to be here with you – from a personal point of view and from an institutional one, and I would even say from a political one. And let me thank Carnegie and all of you here again for this conference and for your constant contribution to this very important debate. A debate that can and must shape the direction of policy making. Now in particular, because I see a lot of confusion in today’s world. And even the most basic rules of our international system seem to be called into question. In an era of power-politics and realpolitik , I would like to be as realistic and as pragmatic as I can – being a woman normally this works quite well. So let me be very clear: the security of our citizens today can only be achieved through non-proliferation and disarmament. It is a matter of security. A new arms race is not the solution to any of the security challenges or threats we face. The Cold-War era is over. The world today is much more complex, much more fragile than 25 years ago. The number of nuclear states has risen – so that there is not just one “nuclear balance” to take into account, but several and overlapping nuclear balances. Henry Kissinger has explained it incredibly well. I come from a very different background, but I do appreciate the wisdom of the old-school Republican realism, especially in these times. In 2014 he assessed that major powers have over-invested in nuclear weapons, at their own peril. I quote: ""The most fearsome of weapons, commanding large shares of each superpowers' defense budget, lost their relevance to the actual crises facing leaders"". As a result, Kissinger assessed, in many cases, I quote again: ""Technological supremacy turned into geopolitical impotence"". Kissinger argues that the “relatively stable nuclear order of the Cold War” simply belongs to a different era. And in today’s world, some nuclear actors might want to show that they are ready to take “apocalyptic decisions,” even if they would have disastrous consequences for everyone, including themselves. So, the logic of deterrence could easily become outdated – and this would definitely be the case, if a criminal or terrorist group had to acquire a weapon of mass destruction. In a fragile world like ours, a nuclear balance of terror would be incredibly dangerous. And the only way to make our citizens more secure runs through non-proliferation and disarmament. The only way forward is to invest together in a strong system of truly global rules. We, Europeans, aim at multilateral disarmament. We all want to guarantee non-proliferation through treaties and verification regimes. This is stated very clearly in our Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy - that I presented at Carnegie a few months ago – and that was agreed by all our 28 Member States – still 28 for a couple of years -, including the nuclear weapon states. So, the European Union will continue to be a strong, consistent, reliable, predictable partner, for all those who believe that security comes through non-proliferation and I guess in this room we are quite the majority. We will keep working as the European Union to preserve, strengthen and expand the current rules. Think of the Non-Proliferation Treaty: it has been the cornerstone of the global security architecture, and today, as it turns fifty, it has become even more important – not less. Or think of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). North Korea’s nuclear tests have shown once again how urgent it is to make the Treaty enter into force. Its Organisation [CTBTO] has provided already the world with a truly global, hi-tech monitoring system for nuclear explosions – something that no single country alone would be able to do. Not only do we need to complete this global monitoring network, we must continue to argue for all countries – including this one, the United States of America – to move towards ratification. This would be an investment in America’s security, and in our collective security. The international community needs unity in its response to nuclear threats, to North Korea’s threats. And unity can only be built and preserved if we all abide by the same rules, if our commitments are truly credible. Unity is also what brought us the deal with Iran: America and Europe, Russia and China, working together. Whatever views you might have on the agreement – and I know here in Washington there are different views - there are some facts that no one can ignore – not opinions, facts. For five times now, five times, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has certified Iran’s compliance with the deal, and it is constantly monitoring Iran’s nuclear programme. I chair regular meetings at ministerial level with the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Iran. And we all assess the implementation of the agreement in all its parts. And the United Nations, as you know well, has thrown its weight behind the deal, endorsing it in the Security Council. So let me state it very clearly, as I always do: It is an agreement that belongs to the entire international community and that the Europeans are determined to preserve because its full and strict implementation is key to our own security. Multilateral diplomacy has achieved something impossible to achieve by any other means - through unity. There is simply no doubt about it. And this is the path we Europeans want to continue to follow. A renewed confrontation among world powers will not serve anyone’s interest – it will only make us more insecure, more exposed to these threats. The right path is the one marked by the new START (STrategic Arms Reduction Treaty) and its implementation. This is the kind of cooperation between Russia and the United States that we Europeans would like to see. Any violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, on the contrary, would endanger a security architecture that, since the end of the Cold War, has made Europe a safer place. A logic of provocation or retaliation cannot apply to nuclear issues. The game has become far too complex and the field far too crowded. A new arms race, far from being a stabilising factor, would spark new tensions, destabilise entire regions and make our world much, much more dangerous. So the answer to today’s instability, to a shifting global balance of power, is more cooperation and stronger global governance. This is what the Europeans stand for. We need to protect the rules we have, enforce them more effectively together, work on our verification regimes, agree on better rules when the situation requires it, develop new tools and mechanisms when needed. We must strengthen our partnerships, build new international alliances, new formats, new spaces for regional cooperation. This is what the European Union believes, and this is our strategic interest. I know that other world powers might not share our views. But I also believe that we are going through a moment of transition, a very unsettled situation, and we have a chance to maybe influence the outcome of this transition. So we need the experts and the academia, the civil society, citizens, those who are dedicated to the nuclear policy agenda to make their voice heard, to make the arguments. We need your expertise and your engagement – not only to analyse the challenges, but also to shape our response, the policy making. To make it more cooperative, which means to us Europeans to make it more effective. What is at stake is global security. We must have learned something from our tragic history. The world today is a dangerous place – a very dangerous place. It is definitely not the time to play with fire. What is at stake is our own security. That is why you will always find the European Union engaged and committed, for nuclear non-proliferation. I thank you very much.  Q&As  Questions from the moderator Q. You just gave such a strong defence of the rules-based international order that Americans and Europeans built together in the post-war era. I wanted to draw you out on that because I think back to the last time you went to Carnegie when you were launching the Global Strategy, that you really were the lead creator of in the EU; you announced it almost simultaneously with the June referendum in the UK to leave the EU; since then we had the US election that's resulted in President Trump. I think there is a lot of questions today about these serious challenges to this rules-based order – both externally but also within our own societies, our public is questioning some of these foundations that have been unquestioned. The Global Strategy was released back in June: would you reassess it at all today and specifically how do you see the role of the United States in this? I was struck at the Munich Security Conference that many of the questions there seem to be about the US role in this order as much as anything else. So I would love to draw you out on that, thanks.  HR/VP Mogherini: Thank you very much for first of all being here together again, it is great and I can confirm being part of the German Marshall Fund fellowship was one of the best experiences in my life. I have learned so much and I have learned I think a lot about America beyond Washington; so that prepares you also for coming surprises in the future. But, no, I would not reassess the Global Strategy at all. And actually, yes, I was presenting the Global Strategy two or three days after the UK referendum. It is more or less nine months now after that moment – seems much longer but it is only nine months - and as we have started to implement the Global Strategy in number of fields, including European Defence, and that has gone very fast on the European Union side with decisions that we took at unanimity, at 28, including the UK. As you might have noticed, the UK has not even yet started to ask to begin the negotiations nine months after the result of the referendum. So, maybe it is not so true that the European Union is slow and bureaucratic and the others can run; because – you know - democracy needs time and procedures.  And this brings me to the rules: in the Global Strategy we say – and I know we share this analysis here - that the only way to cope with a world that is extremely complex when power is diffused is to find common ground to find solutions to problems. The only way you can try to do this is by building cooperation – regional cooperation, international cooperation – through multilateralism, strengthening this rules-based global order. And here I think we touch on one of the big political, even existential questions of our times that are true internally and globally. How do we see the rules? Do we perceive the rules as a constraint for an individual or an individual country or do we consider the rules as a guarantee for having the game played properly? A guarantee for the weaker? A guarantee for the respect of certain things we decide all together? Up to now the rules were perceived as a guarantee. My perception is that in our societies, more and more, we start to question whether the rules are not a constraint to the success of one at the detriment of – maybe - the other. But in the world, this creates chaos. That is why Europeans will and will continue to stand for rules in the global system – be it on trade, be it on diplomacy, be it on security, be it on nuclear issues.  We see this as an investment in a balanced global order. We have not yet developed a proper global order and I think we have the maturity now to see that an investment in – I will make an example – humanitarian aid in the Horn of Africa is also an investment in our own security, because out of the I do not know of many thousands of young boys and girls who suffer from hunger – a certain number of them might become radicalised, immigrate, destabilise countries or regions. So, we need rules, we need investments that are long term visions; we need to cooperate with partners and friends and we need to find this common ground even when problems seem difficult, as we did with the Iran nuclear deal at the end of the day.  So, no, I would not reassess the Global Strategy. All of that is the European way to security, out of what we have learned from our history that is somehow our shared interest.  The role of the United States – you know, it is a bit a surreal for me because now, it is a few months that be it here or in Brussels or in Munich or elsewhere, one of the first questions is what about the US policy on this and that and I say - you do not have to ask me – can I ask you? It is not for me to say. I see that there is still a certain degree of review of policies ongoing and this is one of the reasons why I am here in Washington this week. I am very pleased and honoured to have welcomed Vice-President Pence for an official visit to the EU to discuss together at an early stage what kind of direction the US policy might take in certain fields where – for us – it is priority number one to make clear where the European Union stands: the Iran nuclear deal, full strict implementation by all in all aspects, the climate change agreement, a free and fair global trade system and I could continue. Some crisis management, we need to do together – Syria, Libya, the Middle East Peace Process - we strongly believe in two states, still.  And one last thing I would like to mention – I was particularly worried to see the news coming from Washington on the budget cuts. I know that this is internal, domestic but I was the day before yesterday in Cairo for meetings with the Arab League, the previous day I was in Addis Ababa for meetings with the African Union. If the United States were to reduce significantly their investments, be it on humanitarian or development aid, peace and security operations, the world and certain regions of the world would get completely destabilised; do not forget that the major Syrian refugee crisis, couple of years ago, started because the World Food Programme was underfunded. I hope there is wisdom enough here to keep in mind that investing in America means also investing in places that are far away – it is your own interest.  Q. You mentioned Vice-President Pence's visit to the European Union which I do think was a powerful example of US commitment to the European project. The President will be going to Europe in the first half of this year, if we think about the G7 Summit in Italy, if we think about the NATO Summit, if we think about the G20 meeting in Germany, do you think there will be a US/EU Summit on the margins of any of those meetings?  HR/VP Mogherini: Could be. I know our teams are working on options. We had last summit last summer at the margins of the NATO Summit in Warsaw, but I have to tell you before that I think that the previous one was two years ago which means that we do not necessarily need to have a summit every year – it would be good but what would be more important than everything for me is to come to a summit or to our regular meetings with clear ideas of what we want to do together. What is our shared interest? Why America needs Europe and Europe needs America? From European side, we have it very clear in mind, we need to work together for our security, we need to work together for our economy, millions of jobs depend on our economic relations across the Atlantic - both in Europe and in America. Probably you can imagine how many jobs in America depend on European investments. And also for the global order, because America and Europe together represent by far, by far, the most powerful force in the world in any possible field.  So, we have clear in mind why we want and we need to work with the United States. I think that a summit would be good; I don't exclude it but I don't confirm it at this stage. The important thing for me in this moment is that we keep this dialogue very much open, frequent as it has been the case – I have seen Tillerson [Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State of the United States of America] very often, Matthis [James Matthis, Secretary of Defence of the United States of America] , again Pence [ Mike Pence, Vice-President of the United States of America], I will see him again during my visit here, for the second time in a month -  that we keep this channel open, that we talk and we see together again how the new US course on some policies will develop; on our side we are quite clear on what we want.  Q. If we think about challenges to the rules-based order, certainly one country that comes to mind is Russia. And there have been concerns about Russian abrogation of the INF [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces] Treaty, certainly if you think about the European security context, there is no more fundamental challenge to the post-Cold war order than Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 – it seems thus that this scenario where we see strong transatlantic cooperation continue. The EU has renewed its sanctions against Russia, the Trump administration said it is committed to those sanctions as well. How do you see the EU's relationship with Russia moving forward? Do you see any areas to be optimistic about, the implementation of the Minsk cease-fire agreements? Tell us how you see that moving forward.  HR/VP Mogherini: Well, first of all, just a few days ago, we restated our policy on the illegal annexation of Crimea – it was the  anniversary, just two days ago. This is a very important thing to restate together that both America and Europe; for Europe – no doubt - and for America as well I understand, it is not conceivable that in our century, borders are changed by the use of force, simply unconceivable. This is a fundamental breach of international law.  Having said that, the two key points I would like to underline about this: one is that, yes, it is fundamental that we coordinate our sanctions policy, but I would also like to get out of a black and white picture where the European policy towards Russia is purely the sanctions. That does not correspond to reality. We work with the Russians intensely at my level, at all levels on the Minsk implementation but also on many other things. The sanctions are an instrument to get the full Minsk implementation. For us, the objective in itself is not keeping the sanctions; for us the objective in itself is solving the conflict and have a full implementation of Minsk. We would be happy to lift the sanctions if we had a full implementation of Minsk.  So, our main purpose is first, to continue to coordinate with our American friends on this, we’ll keep our European unity as we have done over the years regardless of different stories that were told and then, we showed that we could be more united than people expected – I think we are proving that again and again on many different files. Second, we work together to have this full implementation of Minsk which means also supporting our Ukrainian friends in their reform agenda – they are going through a complicated process, including on some reforms they need to undertake under the Minsk agreements.  And third, the European Union and Russia have a certain selective engagement. We work together on some issues very well. I give you two, three examples: we work very well on the Iran nuclear deal, constantly – I would say daily. We work very well on the Middle East Peace Process; we share for sure the same kind of perspective there about the two state solution and we worked always very well within the Quartet on the Middle East. But also on other issues, I think of the fact that just one year and a half ago, the European Union launched its military operation in the Mediterranean to save lives at sea and dismantle the smugglers and human traffickers' networks that was endorsed by the UN Security Council that Russia supported. So, we have to get out of this picture that the European Union and Russia are not talking to each other, are not working with each other on anything. We have disagreements, we have different positons, we have a serious problem on Ukraine and with the illegal annexation of Crimea that we tackle every single day and on which we need to work together, Europeans and Americans. But on any file, including the ones that are not necessary the easiest like Syria, we do work together on a daily basis.  Q. When I think back to the European Global Strategy, one of the things that struck me was the focus there of turning vision into common action. Just earlier this month, you announced that the European Union was setting up a headquarters for military training operations which seems to be part of turning a vision into concrete action. I was struck by how this was reported at the least in the US and the British press which was very much in the context of the European Union taking greater responsibility for its security in a post-Brexit environment. So, at this moment, when one of the EU's military most capable Member State is planning its exit, it seems that the other Member States in the EU itself want to step up and say they could do more. I would love to draw you out on what you see this new headquarter is signifying and what it is expect to contribute?  HR/VP Mogherini: It was indeed a historical decision. I said on that occasion we have done more in concrete terms on European defence in the last six months than the last six years. Those of you who are passionate about European history know that European defence was at the beginning the very start of the dream of integrating the continent; then for different reasons, we moved to something else. And as we will celebrate 60 years of the Rome Treaty that was the starting point of the EU, and just like on Saturday in Rome, it is quite a reason of being proud for me, to see that we bring there, 60 years after, the first very concrete operational steps for a European Union that is a much more reliable, credible actor on the military side because we have been always perceived and we have always perceived ourselves as a soft power – Venus and Mars and all those things – but actually, we have already now, 16 military or civilian operations around the world, mainly in Africa but also in the Mediterranean or elsewhere; and we do have also military power. So, this decision we have taken will allow us to plan and conduct these operations in a more coordinated manner.  But what strikes me the most is that, you are right, media-wise, it is perceived as the reaction to the UK leaving. But this decision was taken unanimously at 28 and this is going to be implemented in the coming weeks, actually days now, while the UK has not even started to ask to begin negotiations to exit which means we are moving fast, together, in a very concrete manner, still at 28. Why? Because this is not a reaction to the UK leaving; this is a reaction to the fact that for the European citizens, security matters. We are not doing this for the UK, we are not doing this for the US – sorry to disappoint you -  we are doing it for ourselves. Then, if it is good also for transatlantic relations – which I believe it is – great! But we are doing this because we know that there is no other way to have an efficient, an effective security system and defence system in Europe, if not through European Union integration and coordination processes.  I give you one example that I raised with Matthis [James Matthis, Secretary of Defence of the United States of America] and I think that was extremely interesting for him. We have all this 2% debate - and this is a NATO debate, I am not going to enter that. But, if you want Member States allies in NATO that are also Member States of the European Union, and that is the large majority of them, to go towards better and more spending on defence: first you have to have rules on our budgets that allowed that to happen and these are EU related decisions. Second, in the meantime you can work on the output. Here we are a security community, so we understand each other. In Europe we spend half - 50 per cent - of what America spends on defence. European output on defence is fifteen per cent of the American one, so we have an output gap in Europe given by the fragmentation of our investments. We do not work on the economy of scale yet. Each and every Member State has its own system and sometimes more than one because we are complicated, we Europeans – which is an advantage sometimes because in a complicated world being complicated yourself helps you to understand things.  But in the meantime the Member States figured out that if they want to get to 2 per cent in defence spending - because another thing that Europeans strongly believe is also investing in climate change or in humanitarian [aid] because this prevents conflicts, so for us that is also an investment in security, especially on the conflict prevention - you need to fill in the gap on the output. You can do it through European Union instruments, because the European Union can incentivise common projects, capability developments, industrial research projects that can bring together Member States to spend better together and have a better output, strengthen the capabilities that then are also the disposal of NATO, because it is Member States owned and Member States are the allies. This can be done only through the European Union. So all those who question the relevance of the European Union should think twice also on defence.  Q. Would you see this is as a first step to a European army?  HR/VP Mogherini: I would not say that. No, because, you know, my main objective is to make things advance. You can use nice, evocative images and words and say “you know 15 years from now”, but that vision if you say it like this might raise so many question marks on the next step to be done that you never get there. So you have to have a horizon, but I focus on the small steps that can bring us there. And again we discussed about European army for decades and we have never moved forward with a joint military command. Now we stopped talking about the army, but we have decided on the common command. I would prefer going that way.  Questions from the audience Q. On 17 March, the Global Relations Forum International Task Force on the Sustainability of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) including different experts from 5+1 countries, including my organisation [PIR Centre], India, Turkey, Israel, Iran issued an unanimous statement saying that there is no alternative to the JCPOA and it should not be renegotiated and all the parties should fulfil their obligations in good faith. But at the same time we hear that about the recent British decision of blocking the sale of “yellow cake to Iran” and this is what really concerns Russia, it really concerns a lot of experts worldwide and I wonder what could we do in order to achieve cooperation and fulfilling all the obligations in good faith in which would be after the JCPOA.  HR/VP Mogherini: I fully share the need to fully implement, in all its parts, the JCPOA. Let me stress that this is not a deal that can be partially renegotiated. You know that for sure, but maybe our larger audience does not necessarily know: it is a more than 100 pages of very technical deal that took several years to finalise. And as I said it belongs to the entire international community, it is not a bilateral agreement that can be adjusted here or there. So I do not see the possibility to have a cosmetic or a partial change here or there. And I agree that there is no alternative if we want to avoid that Iran develops a military nuclear programme. So far, as I said, both through the IAEA’s [International Atomic Energy Agency] reports – five of them – and through the Joint Commission Assessments that looks at all the different elements of full compliance in good faith by all actors of the JCPOA, we have always assessed together that there is full compliance in all sides by all actors. And I will personally and the European Union will consistently guarantee that this continues to be the case.  This is for the European Union a key strategic interest and it is also for me a personal responsibility because I still keep the responsibility to chair the Joint Commission and monitor on the implementation. Let me say that this is not only key for security reasons; it is also key for a certain way of conceiving diplomacy and multilateralism. We have invested in this agreement first and foremost because we wanted Iran to be prevented from developing a nuclear weapon and the assessment we have is that this is effectively the case. But there is also a deeper meaning in this which means that even the most difficult and complicated issues can be dealt with by different global powers, having different views but sit together again and again for years, but finally finding a solution, a common ground and implement it together. Two years ago everybody was sceptical about us reaching the agreement and we did it. Then everybody was sceptical the agreement could ever enter into force and we did it. Then everybody was sceptical about the deal being implemented fully and constantly and we did it. So I think we will disappoint the sceptics again and again.  Q: Giving India’s impressive track record on nuclear non-proliferation and the backing it has received from countries like the US itself, you have also led some negotiations efforts in trying to talk with countries like China on the nuclear supplies issues. Do you really see India getting a seat in the table without signing the non-proliferation treaty? And a lot has been talked about the Iran’s nuclear deal, if Iran would to be forced to walk out of it, what would you see as the biggest implication of it and would be the way forward?  HR/VP Mogherini: I will not comment on the part of the question on India. On Iran I do not think personally that Iran can be forced to walk out of the agreement. I think Iran has invested a big deal of technical competences that they have, political capital of the leadership – all of the leadership, from the very top - in reaching this agreement, which was not an easy exercise. And I think they would stay committed to full implementation of the agreement. And as I said, Europeans will always be there to make sure that full implementation is taking place, but also that the environment among us – the 3+3 plus Iran or 5+1 and Iran, no matter how you want to call them – that the environment is constructive, respectful and that good faith applies as mentioned by your colleague. Europe is there to guarantee this. And I am confident that Iran will not either be forced to walk away, nor walk away.  Q: We often talk about Russia’s violations, so my readers often ask if there are concerns on the Russian side concerning the INF that Americans aren’t aware of?  HR/VP Mogherini: If we talk about of concerns of which Americans might be aware of or not, I guess the question is more for you than for me. I cannot speak for the United States yet. But as I said we see the nuclear architecture on nuclear deals as a major achievement that has to be preserved, which first of all means we count on all to stick to commitments and preserve the agreements we have also because this is essential to European security.  Q: You wisely mentioned unity. It is pretty clear that there is a large unity in states that do not have nuclear weapons to those that do to quickly get rid of them. That unity has culminated now into the negotiations that will start next week, as you know, in the United Nations, and negotiations should finish sometime in June for a possible convention to ban nuclear weapons. What do you think that outcome of these negotiations would be and how it would affect our work?  Q. In Europe there is a lot of anti-establishment parties that are getting traction. How would you envisage a message to the people that are unsatisfied with the establishment?  HR/VP Mogherini: The first question is actually easier than the second. I would not have expected that. There is indeed a lack of unity when it comes to the nuclear weapons ban within the broader international community, within the European Union, within NATO. I cannot predict how the negotiations will end up. It seems difficult to me to imagine that a few months of negotiations on this issue will deliver us unified result, I would be surprise in that case, but in Italian we have an expression that I could never translate in English: ‘Hope is the last to die’. Do you say that in English? Yes? Ok. So you never know. But indeed on that issue there is a lack of unity across different set-ups, communities, and that goes beyond the nuclear powers and non-nuclear powers. It crosses a bit lines to my understanding. We always try to facilitate unity, starting from our Member States on common ground, and again let me tell you that what I said during my remarks, there are divisions, there are different views on this issue but there is inside the European Union, including the nuclear powers, a clear common goal of going towards a multilateral disarmament on nuclear issues. This is a common and shared goal we have in the Union.  On anti-establishment, first of all thank you for putting the question this way. Because I have always been convinced that it is not about populism, it is not about far-right, it is about establishment and anti-establishment forces which is a very complicated issue to tackle and I cannot say that I am glad because I am not, but finally we go out of this narrative that this is an European thing. You see it here, it is everywhere in the world. I think it is about taking responsibility from the establishment decision-making. I can give you the European example but I guess here the dynamics might be similar. In the European Union, there is no abstract entity that shows up in Brussels, an alien coming from the moon and materialising in the Brussels’ building, taking decisions and then the 28 [Member States] have to implement. It does not exist. It is the 28 [Member States] Prime Ministers, Presidents, Chancellors, ministers, coming together to Brussels, taking decision, most of the time by unanimity and then going back home and say ‘you know, Brussels asks what we have to do’, which means not taking responsibilities for your own choices. The only place that this does not work is Brussels itself, because Belgium cannot blame Brussels but apart from that – it is true; it is sad, but it is true.  So I think the answer is in us politicians or us establishment – I have a difficult in saying that, but anyway… - not only to be a bit more concrete on the things we do and again look again at the concrete outcome options, operational decisions we take and explain them, but also taking responsibility and explaining why we are taking decisions, why it is good, or in some cases you lose a battle and you explain why you lost the battle and you get the battle next time. Being a little bit more transparent not only on the handling of the budget – which is a very important thing - but then sometimes you see the contradiction of anti-establishment forces that are completely non transparent on handling the money, including public money. So there is not really coherence there. But if we want to take more political responsibility, explaining to our citizens that in the European case Europe is us, it is not a third party. You are from a certain city, a certain country and you have a certain European identity, complementary to the others.  We need to have the political leadership that is able to exercise and explain a European responsibility also because otherwise – sorry I am too long but this is a serious thing – we run the risk of leaving the most dangerous of the paradoxes that you hear, this discourse in Europe being about regaining sovereignty from Brussels - but in the world of today how do you regain sovereignty on a smaller national scale but then you have to go and negotiate with China or the United States? Ok, good luck. But even France or Germany and I often say – I apologise, they must have heard me saying this a lot of the time – European countries are divided in two kinds: the small ones and the ones that have not yet realised they are small in the world of today. I am afraid that this is also true for other places that are a bit bigger, but still need friends, because in the world of today alone you do not go far.  So, I think and often say this, the only way for Europeans to regain sovereignty is through the European Union, through our unity, because this increases our weight. I give you one last example: trade. I know it is not nuclear security related, but do you allow me? I know it sounds strange here that single Member States of the European Union cannot negotiate a trade agreement bilaterally with a third country. This is a common decision we have taken. Why? Because we are much stronger if we negotiate a trade agreement at 28. We are the biggest market in the world, so when we negotiate at 28 or even in the future at 27 we will be the biggest market in the world. We negotiate from a position of strength so it is a matter of being at a negotiating table with more instruments to get a better deal. Obviously, the ones sitting at the other side of the table negotiating the deal might be interested in splitting us but it is not in our interest to split and this should be quite easy to understand. So that is why it is not giving up the sovereignty: it is exercising our sovereignty together which makes us stronger in the world.

Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini during the press conference following the Quartet Meeting on Libya,18.03.2017,18.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/22990_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini during the press conference following the Quartet Meeting on Libya Check against delivery! Q1 : My question to Mme Mogherini, with regards to the agreement signed between Rome and Libya last November on illegal migration, could we expand this agreement to include EU countries with the North-African countries? HR/VP Mogherini. Well, first of all, I think you refer to the Agreement that was signed in January, I would not obviously comment on something that is bilateral between one of our Member States and the Libyan authorities but that agreement has been welcomed by the European Union, Heads of States and Governments and we have decided on our side to have an intensified cooperation with the Libyan authorities on managing together the dramatic situation of the migratory flows. I would like to underline here the fact that every time we discuss Libya, the question that comes to the European Union is always migration-related. I understand very well the reasons for that but I would like to underline very clearly that the European Union work and attention and priority on the Libyan crisis is something we do not see purely through the migration-issue lens. This is a humanitarian tragedy, we feel the responsibility to tackle, together with our Libyan friends but also together with our African friends and our Arab friends and the United Nations. Also because the trafficking and smuggling business is part of one of the problems that Libya is facing in this moment and the loss of lives both inside Libya - before the flow goes to Libya and in the sea – is something we all have to take responsibility for to stop it – the European Union is doing its part – and we are trying to increase the level of effectiveness of our work in that respect – saving lives first of all. But I would like to take this opportunity to say that our work on Libya, with Libya, for Libya is not to be seen through this lens – this is not the way Europeans see it and I hope that this can be also the way that our Arab and Libyan friends understand. And this is why I take the opportunity of having the floor to thank the Secretary General, first of all for having expressed our united and common position, but also for the invitation that the League of Arab States, the African Union, the United Nations extended to the European Union to join this format. I believe that the four of us working together is a very important sign of unity from our side, that we hope can accompany and encourage a Libyan unity to put an end to the crisis. And the fact that we decided to work in this format also in the future, coordinate positions, coordinate actions, I believe can be something extremely helpful if the Libyans will take their own responsibility to come together. We will be there together with all our different instruments and positions and Member States to support and accompany them. Q2: For the European Union, thank you very much for joining the Quartet in order to find a solution to the Libyan,  but what in your mind, do you have in order to help the Libyan people? HR/VP Mogherini : First of all, for the European Union and for all the 28 Member States of the European Union, Libya is a vital priority. We have always been working with all our Libyan friends to accompany them in a respectful manner, in a process that has to be, as Martin [Kobler, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya] has said, a Libyan process. So the European attitude is for sure a respectful one but accompanying and supporting the Libyans as they try to come together and find the way forward to unite the country. We have also a very relevant practical package of support measures that is ongoing, with €120 million that are being invested in projects covering the health sector, governance, security but also civil society, protection of people, youth and education. So we are implementing projects on the ground wherever possible to improve the lives of the Libyans on the ground, the daily life of what we would call ordinary Libyans that have been suffering so far too long from a dramatic situation in the country . We wish that this support can even increase with the adequate interlocutors, from an institutional perspective, covering the entire country. But I give you just a couple of examples of projects we are running or help that we are providing, or operations we are establishing. I was myself handing over diplomas to the first ninety Libyan coastguards that we trained on board of our European Union vessels in the Mediterranean.  In this way reinforcing the capacity of the Libyan authorities to control the territorial waters of Libya, this has a relevance for securing the waters, but also this has relevance to dismantle the traffickers' networks and save lives where they are lost in this moment. It has also an economic impact, because if the territorial waters of Libya are secured, the fishery activities can restart in safety; and this has an impact on the economic life of so many coastal communities in the country.  In the same manner, we are supporting the delivery of basic services locally; we are working very much with the municipalities of Libya now since many years to support the delivery of basic services to the population. But also, we have a strong political engagement and again, being part of this format for us is key to as, I said accompany, respectfully but with all our potential of incentives and leverage, the Libyans coming together to run their country. This is why, the Secretary General hinted at that, we would be honoured to host the next Quartet meeting in Brussels in the coming weeks. I would also be honoured to address the League of Arab States' Summit in Amman in a few weeks' time. I really believe that the Arabs, the Europeans, the Africans, within and under the leadership and umbrella of the United Nations, can really create the space for Libyans to unite. If we unite for their support, they will find the political will and the space to do so as well. Q3: How does Europe view reported growing Russian involvement in the Libyan conflict? HR/VP Mogherini: It does not surprise me at all and it does not surprise us at all. Russia being a very important permanent member of the Security Council, my assessment has been that Russia has always been highly involved in the discussions but also in the work on the Libyan file but this is more for the UN Representative [Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, Martin Kobler] to mention. What I can add is that I had myself several times and on several occasions – including very recently – the opportunity to discuss with my Russian counterpart, Minister [of foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey] Lavrov, specifically about Libya. And I can say that it seems to me that we share the same concerns about the risks of the situation getting worse, especially on the security side or in terms of the division of the country, and that we see the same need to have a space for the Libyans to unite. There is no way in which the country can be ruled from one side against the other and I think this is a common basis on which we can work. I would also like to add that the Russian Federation in New York one year and a half ago supported in the UN Security Council the mandate given to the European Union military operation in the Mediterranean [EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia]  to dismantle the traffickers’ networks and that we are operating also on the basis of that mandate that the Russian Federation at that time contributed to shape. So, I would say that for sure we do not see in identical manners on every single aspect of the Libyan file but for sure there is a common ground for common action and there is a constant engagement ongoing between the European Union and the Russian Federation as it is the case with other actors that are relevant to the Libyan crisis.

MEPs and Ukrainian MPs reviewed reform progress in Ukraine,16.03.2017,16.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/22863_en,,"""After the two-day long fruitful and collegial discussion with the Members of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I am sure that our Ukrainian partners have understood that they are here, in the European Parliament, among friends” said Dariusz Rosati (EPP, PL), Chair of the the EP delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Association Committee on Thursday, after MEPs had had a two-day working session with their counterparts from Ukrainian Parliament in Strasbourg. On 15-16 March MEPs and Members of Verkhovna Rada met in an EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Association Committee in Strasbourg to debate the reform agenda of Ukraine including the implementation of the Association Agreement, as well as the security and humanitarian situation, the Minsk agreements, as well as human rights issues. At the end of the meeting, they adopted a joint statement and recommendations. After the meeting Mr. Rosati issued the following statement: “I had the opportunity to chair my first EU-Ukraine PAC. Our meeting comes at a pertinent moment, following the escalation of violence in Donbas around Avdiivka and prior to the sad third anniversary of the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia. Members took stock of the progress of the comprehensive reform efforts of Ukraine in many areas and the implementation of the Association Agreement/DCFTA. The issue of eradicating corruption was and continues to be one of our primary focuses and sustaining the independence of the newly established anti-corruption institutions is crucial in this respect. We see that the cleaning up of the Augean stables have seriously started. During the meeting we also focused on the critical security situation in Eastern Ukraine which is subject to a Russian military aggression. We have reiterated the support of the EU for Ukrainian independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders. We continue to be committed to the Minsk Agreements, which we consider as the only political and peaceful solution to the aggression in the East. However Members clearly realise that there has been no progress in its implementation due to the lack of Russian genuine commitment to do so. We therefore strongly support the roll-over of restrictive measures targeting Russia until the Minsk Agreements are fully implemented, and ask EU Council to consider introducing further sanctions. We also urge the international community not to forget about the fate of Crimea that should not become a forgotten and inconvenient spot on the map of Europe. We request to explore the possibility to establish an international format of negotiations aiming at putting an end to the occupation of Crimea with the participation of the EU.” Strasbourg"
European Parliament urged Russia to free Ukrainian prisoners,16.03.2017,16.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/22844_en,,"The European Parliament urged Russia to free those Ukrainians held captive in Russian prisons. This is noted in the resolution adopted on 16 March. The European Parliament reiterates its condemnation of the illegal annexation three years ago of the Crimean peninsula and the City of Sevastopol by Russia. It deplores violations of freedom of speech, abuse of the media, forced imposition of Russian citizenship and the discriminatory policies imposed by the so-called authorities against, in particular, Crimea’s ethnic Tatar minority. Russia should stop giving ""all inhabitants of Crimea Russian passports"" and ""release without further delay all illegally and arbitrarily detained Ukrainian citizens, both in Russia and in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, and to provide for their safe return"", urge MEPs. It should also ""immediately cease the practices of persecution"", as many cases have been reported of “disappearances”, torture and systematic intimidation of local citizens opposed to the annexation of Crimea. MEPs reiterate their call for the immediate reversal of the so-called Supreme Court of Crimea’s decision of 26 April 2016 to ban the Mejlis, the legitimate and recognised representative body of ethnic Crimean Tatars, an indigenous people of the peninsula whose ""rights have been gravely violated"".

Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the read-out of the meeting of the College of Commissioners,14.03.2017,14.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/22699_en,,"Strasbourg, 14 March 2017 Check against delivery! Thank you. As you said, the College [of Commissioners] today adopted the [Joint] Communication [to the European Parliament and the Council – Elements] for an EU Strategy for Syria that I will then present to the Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 3 April, and that will constitute the basis for our further work on the country to support Syrians, to support the future of Syria and also will contribute to shaping the international [Brussels] Conference [on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region] that the European Union will host and co-chair in Brussels on 5 April together with other partners, but I'll come back to that in a moment. Let me start by saying that we adopt this Joint Communication, in the same days where we remember the 6th anniversary of the beginning of the conflict. It was March 2011 and since then we had 320,000 people losing their lives, millions that were forced to flee their country, and we continue to see victims every single day. Just a few days ago we've seen victims in different parts of the country, in Damascus but also in Homs. And I have to say that this decision we have taken today reflects the need that the European Union feels to fulfil its responsibility. Every time I meet Syrians, and especially Syrian women and children, I see, yes, a lot of desperation, a lot of suffering, but at the very end of the story you also recognise still a sparkle of hope and a smile when they mention their country, when they mention the need to reconstruct the country, when they mention the fact that they would be ready to guarantee a future for a united, democratic Syria.  So, we have worked on this Communication, we've worked on this strategy, to give a clear message to all the Syrians that the European Union is at their side. Obviously, we have done this already in these last years: we've been the first donor for Syrians, mobilising over €9.4 billion for Syrians both inside the country and in neighbouring countries. Only from the EU budget, inside Syria we've mobilised in the last years €939 million, and I give you just a few examples of what this means in concrete terms: this means some 2 million people having access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene items; this means almost one million people receiving food; this means one million people receiving shelter; and hundreds of thousands of children being covered by child protection programmes or receiving education. And just last year we have helped, only with our humanitarian support programmes, 350,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan and 665,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon – and I could continue on a very long list of what this money means in concrete terms for the real lives of real people.  But the European Union has not only played its leading humanitarian role in these years; we have also played our diplomatic and political role. And you might remember in September here in Strasbourg, President [of the European Commissioner, Jean-Claude] Juncker mentioned the need for the European Union to become even more of an active player on the political scene when it comes to Syria, and this is exactly what we are doing today. Politically and diplomatically, we have started in the last months a regional initiative with the key eight regional players - the European Union being perfectly placed to work equally and with the same level of trust with Tehran and with Riyadh; with Ankara and with Beirut; and I could continue. We have worked together with them at the ministerial level - and not only - to identify the common ground on the basis of which the regional players could facilitate a solution that has to be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned, but can be accompanied by the regional actors.  We have identified some common ground that we have provided to the UN – and in particular to my good friend [UN Special Envoy for Syria] Staffan de Mistura – as he has reconvened talks in Geneva among the Syrians. We have constantly provided him and his team the outcome of our preparatory work. This political work that the European Union has done goes together with the continuous support we are giving to the Syrian opposition, to civil society organisations – in particular women organisations – in Syria and now especially in the framework of the Geneva talks, but also looking ahead to enabling them to play a role in the transition and post-transition periods, as we believe that all Syrians deserve to take part in the definition and construction of their future, for a united, inclusive, and democratic Syria where they deserve to live in freedom, diversity, dignity, securely and safely.  This can seem a remote future; it is for sure not the present of Syria, but we believe that working to make this happen is in itself one fundamental element to give the Syrians the space to invest in themselves shaping the future of the country. This is why this strategy is so important at this time: because it comes in a moment when the intra-Syrian talks have restarted in Geneva under the UN auspices; a ceasefire mechanism has been established as a result of the Astana talks, with which we are in constant contact; and we come in, as the European Union, in connection with the rest of the international community, on future engagement on Syria to support the future of the country, looking beyond the current state of play in a longer term perspective and starting to prepare and to coordinate already now. This is going to be what we will do especially on 5 April at the ‘Brussels Conference on Supporting the future of Syria and the Region’ that we will co-chair together – as I said – with the UN but also with Germany, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and the UK.  The Conference will first of all give the strong support of the international community to the UN-led political process but also we will check where we are on the pledges that the international community did last year in London. The European Union, as always, has fulfilled all its commitments, but we will have to check where we are on some needs that might still be open.  But we will also start to look at the future and how we and the international community can support the future of the country in terms of reconciliation, in terms of stabilisation, in terms of also coordinating our collective engagement on post-agreement planning and assistance, including on reconstruction once a political transition is underway. Let me say that too many times the international community has not prepared the post-conflict time in time. Too many times we got to the point of an agreement without being ready with the international assistance to be put in place immediately. And we have seen in so many places that the consequences of this have been quite heavy.  So, this time we want to be ready properly, coordinating, and also using this element of looking beyond the current situation as a dividend for peace that could encourage different parties in Syria to make the necessary compromises and begin a political transition under an agreement brokered by the United Nations.  This will involve Syria, Syrians but also the rest of the region in particular the neighbouring countries and our work with them will continue both in the present, in terms of supporting the Syrian refugees that they host and especially supporting the hosting communities in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon as we are doing, but also in terms – as I said – of turning a proxy war into a proxy peace.  I believe and we are seeing that there is some common ground that can be found with the international players, with the regional actors who can facilitate this process that again, as I said,  it's up to the Syrians now to lead under the UN auspices. I would finish by saying that the European Union is perfectly positioned to play this role, as I said, not only from a humanitarian but also from a political perspective. We are, for Syrians and in the region, a credible, reliable, trusted partner, first of all able to work with all the different regional players equally, and also with a humanitarian presence on the ground that can constitute a fruitful starting point to help local reconciliation processes, being a humanitarian player who has helped and not bombed the country – if I can be a little bit blunt.  I would like to finish by thanking my colleagues and friends [European] Commissioner [for Neighbourhood Policy & Enlargement Negotiations, Johannes] Hahn and [European] Commissioner [for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos] Stylianides with whom we have worked on this [Joint] Communication, but also concretely, every day on the ground, and we will continue to work as a team, heading towards the presentation of the Communication to the Foreign Ministers of the European Union on 3 April and then continuing our work for the conference and beyond.  Thank you.  Q&A Q1: You mentioned this very complex matrix of organisations – the Astana talks, the UN, the eight regional actors. How do you think that this is going to be brought together? And you mentioned that a proxy war is being replaced by a proxy peace. That is just the particular role that Russia has played in this conflict. And I am just wondering: are they willing to play a role in this proxy peace? HR/VP: First of all, I wish this was already turned into a proxy peace. We are not there yet, and I want to make this very clear. We are starting to look at the future, we are starting to look at the post-conflict, but we are still in a conflict, and every single day we have people dying on the ground. But you cannot build peace if you do not believe at least a little bit that this is possible, and this is why we have started this work. Yes, I believe there can be a space for all international players and especially all regional actors that live with borders and dynamics that are interlinked with the situation in Syria, so that they can see that it is far more convenient in this moment to turn this is into a proxy peace and allow Syria to restart somehow, with a political transition that will be needed. When it comes to the complicated set-up of different meetings: it is probably because it is a complicated conflict, and so you have different layers that are needed. On one side you have the military talks that are necessary, and that is happening mainly in Astana. As you know, the European Union is not a military player in this conflict. I am proud and I always underline the fact that Europeans are proud not to be a military actor in this scene. And we have seen that the work in Astana – led by Russia, Turkey and, to a different extent, Iran – has led to at least some provisions of ceasefire and some mechanisms on ceasefire, which is something we welcome – not only we, but also the UN Security Council has welcomed [it] with a Resolution. But it is clear that The – with a capital T – The process is the UN-led process in Geneva. That is the place where Syrians come together, that is the place where the entire international community supports intra-Syrian talks and where the parameters of a political solution are worked out and found – hopefully found. What we are putting in place, as the European Union, is a supporting work for the UN, because we recognise the value of multilateralism embodied in the UN at the maximum level; and also because any outcome will have to go through the Security Council again, for sure. So the spirit with which we are working – being it on humanitarian or political and diplomatic tracks – is in support to the UN. And the work we have done, as I said, with the 8 regional actors we have convened and we are continuing to meet – constantly, bilaterally in Brussels – has always been provided to the UN as a content that provides the basis for their elaborations on governance, on transition, on reconciliation, on different other elements. So we are at the service of a process that we recognise is led by the UN in Geneva, also because it is the Syrians that have to decide on the future of their country. But again, our work can support, and the Brussels Conference will gather also – hopefully – political support to give a push and encourage the Syrians and the Syrian parties convening in Geneva to take the necessary decisions for them to live together, feeling home in their own country.  Q2: How do you expect to overcome the political problems that can arise from the fact that Turkey is at the same time a key player in this conflict, but there are also rising political difficulties with the European Union – not only in this case with the latest development in Holland, but also their relationship with us is becoming more and more difficult? And they are clearly opting for being closer to Russia. And also you did not mention the United States – what is the role of Washington in this plan? HR/VP: I will be in Washington again for my second visit in the last month from Sunday onwards exactly for, obviously, a bilateral visit. But also because we will have there the meeting of The Global Coalition against Da'esh, at ministerial level, where I would expect that the new US administration will also present its anti-Da'esh strategy that will probably cover also part of the Syria strategy. You should not ask me but them what is going to be their Syria strategy – I am presenting here the EU Syria Strategy. But what I can say is that from the first elements I have received from my interlocutors in Washington during these first weeks of intense contacts with them –them being Secretary of State [Rex] Tillerson, Secretary of Defence [James] Mattis, but also Vice President [Mike] Pence and many contacts at different levels in the White House and in Congress – I see a certain engagement still on the Syria file, but also the recognition of the fact that other players have a fundamental role to play, including or starting from the European Union. It is not for me to comment or present positions that are going to be in case eventually presented by the US administration. What I can say is that in our first exchanges, our talks on Syria have been productive and I have presented obviously to my US interlocutors the main features of the work we are, not only doing, but also planning to do on Syria. And they have been extremely well perceived and received; so I see good space for cooperation there. But again it is not for me to comment or to present elements of a strategy that is not a European one, it is an American one. On Turkey itself, you might have seen, I have released a statement yesterday with Commissioner Hahn and I would not elaborate further on that. I have nothing more to comment beyond what we have said yesterday. What I can say is that our work with Turkey on this file for instance – on Syria – but also on other files has been in these weeks and months constructive, very constructive. I have been in contact with the Foreign Minister Çavuşoğlu very, very often in the last three, four months; in particular Turkey being one of the key interlocutors we had to create connections between our regional work, our EU regional work on Syria and the Astana meetings. And I think we still share an interest to bring peace in Syria and to bring this war to an end. So our work on the Syria file with Turkey in these months has been not only constructive but also very intense.  Q3: Due domande in italiano, se posso; una sulla Siria. Lei ha più volte detto che non c'era soluzione militare a questo conflitto, di essere fiera che l'Union europea non è un attore militare, ma il processo di Astana, i meccanismi di cessate il fuoco, alla fine non sono la conferma che una soluzione militare c'era ed era quella imposta, in qualche modo, dalla Russia? La seconda domanda, se mi permette, sulla Turchia, perché il Parlamento europeo in una risoluzione – lo hanno ribadito oggi i presidenti dei due principali gruppi – chiede di sospendere, congelare i negoziati di adesione, anche in virtù di quanto sta accadendo in queste ore. Cosa risponde a questa richiesta presente in una risoluzione del Parlamento?  Alto rappresentante / Vicepresidente Mogherini: Su questa seconda domanda, come ho detto, non ho intenzione di commentare. Ho rilasciato ieri, insieme al Commissario Hahn, una dichiarazione particolarmente esaustiva, non soltanto sulle tensioni attuali tra la Turchia e alcuni governi di alcuni Stati membri dell'Unione europea, ma anche – e soprattutto, vorrei dire – su un importante rapporto della Commissione di Venezia relativo al merito della proposta di modifica costituzionale. Quindi abbiamo già parlato ieri e non ho nulla da aggiungere a riguardo. Sulla soluzione militare, sulla Siria: credo che esattamente quello che è avvenuto in questi ultimi mesi sia la dimostrazione del fatto che non c'è soluzione militare al conflitto siriano. C'è sicuramente bisogno di avere una strategia anche militare nella lotta contro Da'esh, ma se ci fosse stata una soluzione puramente militare al conflitto, degli scambi, degli incontri a livello militare come sono avvenuti ad Astana sarebbero stati sufficienti per portare la fine del conflitto, cosa che invece non è avvenuta in questi mesi. Questo perché abbiamo sempre saputo che dei meccanismi d'introduzione e di monitoraggio del cessate il fuoco sono indispensabili, se non altro per creare delle situazioni di calma sul terreno – relativa, purtroppo, ma comunque, diciamo così, un passo in avanti –, ma non sono sufficienti a creare quelle condizioni politiche di fine del conflitto, di costruzione della pace, di transizione politica, di inclusività e di unità per il paese, altrimenti questo sarebbe avvenuto attraverso questi incontri che si sono svolti a livello militare. Questo significa che tutti, compresi i promotori degli incontri di Astana – ai quali, come ho detto, riconosciamo il ruolo dell'aver positivamente introdotto dei meccanismi di cessate il fuoco, anche se parziali e anche se non perfetti –, ma loro stessi riconoscono nel processo politico, puramente politico, e puramente intra-siriano condotto sotto l'egida delle Nazioni Unite a Ginevra il luogo e il processo che può portare ad una soluzione del conflitto. Ed è la stessa valutazione che facciamo anche noi, ed è per questo che sosteniamo pienamente il lavoro di Staffan de Mistura e delle Nazioni Unite e il nostro lavoro politico e diplomatico è volto a rafforzare, a sostenere, ad accompagnare questo lavoro che si svolge a Ginevra. Per questo credo che la sequenza e il coordinamento che c'è stato e che continua a esserci tra gli incontri di Astana sul piano militare, i nostri incontri a livello regionale, la nostra iniziativa regionale, il nostro lavoro sul piano umanitario, ma anche sull'inizio della programmazione e della pianificazione del post-conflitto e della ricostruzione, collegato ad una transizione politica, possano bene accompagnare questa ripresa degli incontri tra le parti siriane a Ginevra sotto l'egida delle Nazioni Unite.  Q3 : [Translated from IT] Two questions, the first one on Syria. You said several times that there was no military solution to this conflict and that you were proud that the EU is not a military actor – but are the Astana process and the ceasefire mechanisms not the confirmation that there was indeed a military solution – and it was the one somehow imposed by Russia? My second question is on Turkey, because the European Parliament has asked in a resolution – the Presidents of the two main political groups have repeated that today – to suspend, freeze the access negotiations, also due to what is happening right now. What do you say to this request? HR/VP: [Translated from IT] On this second question, as I said, I do not intend to comment. I gave a declaration with Commissioner Hahn yesterday which was particularly exhaustive, not just on the current tensions between Turkey and the governments of some EU Member States, but also – and above all, I would like to say – on an important report of the Venice Commission regarding the proposal for constitutional change. We have therefore already discussed yesterday and I have nothing to add regarding that. On the military solution, on Syria: I believe that precisely what happened in the past months is a demonstration of the fact that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict. There is certainly a need to have a strategy that is also military in the fight against Da'esh. But if there had been a purely military solution to the conflict, then some exchanges and meetings at military level such as those that have taken place in Astana would have been sufficient to get to the end of the conflict, which instead has not happened in the past months. This is because we have always known that mechanisms to introduce and monitor the ceasefire are essential, at least to create a situation of calm on the ground – a relative calm, unfortunately, but still a step forward –, but they are not sufficient to create the political conditions for the end of the conflict, for peace-building, political transition and inclusiveness and unity for the country. Otherwise this would have happened through these meetings that have taken place at military level. This means that everyone, including the promoters of the Astana meetings – of which, as I have said, we acknowledge the role of positively introducing ceasefire mechanisms, though partial and not perfect – but they themselves recognise in the purely political and purely inner-Syrian process led under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva the place and the process that can lead to a solution of the conflict. And that is the same evaluation of the situation we make as well, and that is why we fully support the work of Staffan de Mistura and of the UN, and our political and diplomatic work aims to strengthen, support, accompany this work that is being done in Geneva. That is why I believe that the sequence and the coordination that has taken place – and that continues to take place – of the meetings in Astana on the military level, our meetings at a regional level – our Regional Initiative – and our work on the humanitarian side and also on the beginning of the planning of the post-conflict phase and of the reconstruction, connected to a political transition, can well match this resumption of the meetings of the Syrian parties in Geneva under the auspices of the UN.  Q4 : Quand on parle avec des Syriens qui sont ici depuis longtemps, donc avant la situation de conflit, et aussi avec les réfugiés, ils nous disent: mais vous savez, les représentants de l'opposition – on ne voit pas ce qu'ils représentent. C'est très troublant d'entendre cela, et ils considèrent qu'ils ne sont pas représentés correctement. Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ? HR/VP: Les Syriens, j'en rencontre beaucoup. Je serais tentée de demander – à vous-même ou à n'importe qui dans cette salle – si nous nous sentons pleinement représentés par un parti ou l'autre. C'est la diversité d'une société qui, bien sûr, a des connotations politiques mais aussi ethniques, religieuses, extrêmement complexes. Il n'y a pas un Syrien comme l'autre. Il y a une diversité de la société qui était là avant le conflit et qui est exacerbée par le conflit. Et c'est pour cela que de notre côté – du côté de l'Union européenne – on soutient le travail de l'opposition politique dans ses plusieurs formes, parce que l'opposition aussi est formée de plusieurs partis politiques, de plusieurs organisations, parce qu'ils arrivent à avoir un rôle bien préparé, unifié et constructif pendant les négociations à Genève; mais on soutient aussi les plusieurs groupes de la société civile, à partir des femmes, mais aussi d'autres formations, religieuses ou pas, qui représentent la diversité de la société syrienne. Je pense que c'est une richesse, et le danger, c'est que le futur de la Syrie – si la transition politique ne démarre pas comme elle devrait – ne représentera pas la diversité, la richesse de la société syrienne comme elle est. Et c'est pour cela que nous insistons tellement en tant qu’Union européenne, mais aussi avec les autres dans la communauté internationale, sur le fait que le futur de la Syrie ne peut qu'être un futur inclusif. Parfois on fait référence à la nécessite de protéger des minorités – je pense personnellement que pour la Syrie, cela va au-delà de protéger des minorités, cela doit aller dans la direction de faire de sorte que chaque Syrien et chaque Syrienne trouve sa place comme citoyen et citoyenne dans un pays qui est vraiment extrêmement complexe et diversifié en tant que base sociale et identité. Et on a vu dans la région que chaque fois que cet élément de la protection de la diversité n'est pas pris en considération d'une façon profonde, cela amène après à des problèmes majeurs. C'est pour cela que ce sont seulement les Syriens qui savent vraiment comment construire le futur inclusif – unitaire et inclusif en même temps – de leur pays, et nous pouvons aider, nous pouvons soutenir, nous pouvons accompagner ce processus.  Q5 : Ma question va être un peu différente. Ce serait plutôt de  savoir si dans ce document il y a des orientations qui sont d'ordre sécuritaire, et notamment je pense aux options qui étaient préparées par le SEAE  – il me semble une possible mission de soutien aux  forces en Iraq ? HR/VP: Cette stratégie est ciblée sur la Syrie. On a une stratégie plus régionale qui est la stratégie qu'on avait adoptée, si je me trompe pas, il y a deux ans plus ou moins, qui est encore valable et qui couvre en même temps la situation en Syrie et la situation aussi en Iraq et dans la région dans un sens plus large. Et cela est sûrement quelque chose que l'on discute mais que l'on ne décide pas du côté de la Commission mais, comme vous le savez bien, du côté du Conseil. Ce n'est pas pour ne pas répondre à la question mais c'est pour rester un peu ciblé sur le fait que maintenant c'est vraiment un travail de soutien – pas seulement humanitaire mais aussi politique – à la transition syrienne et au processus de mettre fin au conflit en Syrie. Mais il y a aussi un travail qu'on est en train de faire sur l'Iraq et le reste de la région, en particulier dans le cadre de la coalition anti-Da'esh. Comme vous le savez, je l’ai dit avant, je vais être à Washington la semaine prochaine pour la réunion ministérielle de la coalition anti-Da'esh, parce que l’Union européenne en tant que telle fait partie de la coalition, sur des aspects non-militaires. On travaille surtout sur le déminage et sur le travail sur les zones libérées de Da'esh. C'est un travail qu'on continue à faire mais aussi de soutien aux forces de sécurité en Iraq et de renforcement du travail local. C’est un travail qui continue, c'est aussi une réflexion qui est en cours, avec les Etats membres, de comment on peut faire plus et mieux. Cela va continuer, mais ce n'est pas l'objet spécifique de cette stratégie-ci, qui est ciblée sur notre travail avec et sur la Syrie.  Q6 : Madame Mogherini, je voulais savoir concernant la situation des Kurdes en Syrie, parce que sur le plan militaire tout le monde dit ''nous sommes avec les Kurdes'' mais sur le plan humanitaire et politique, quelle est la politique de l’Union européenne à cet égard ? HR/VP: J'ai déjà dit que la Syrie a une population qui est extrêmement variée, et la position de l’Union européenne est celle de garantir que chacun et chacune des citoyens de la Syrie trouve sa place, pas seulement comme minorité protégée mais comme protagoniste du futur du pays. Et je pense que cela répond aussi à votre question; cela, pour nous, vaut pour tous les différents backgrounds – pour les différentes communautés, pour les différentes identités qui composent le pays. Cette diversité doit être préservée et chaque partie de la population en Syrie doit être capable de trouver sa place non seulement dans la vie civile du pays mais aussi dans la vie institutionnelle et  politique du pays dans le futur. Mais là, ce n'est pas pour l’Union européenne de dessiner la gouvernance de la Syrie dans le futur. On peut assister, on peut aider, on peut accompagner ce processus, mais c'est dans les mains des Syriens, de tous les Syriens de décider quel type de transition politique ils vont mettre en place dans le futur post-conflit – en espérant qu'on va arriver au post-conflit, et c'est sur quoi on travaille.

Antitrust: Commission invites comments on Gazprom commitments concerning Central and Eastern European gas markets,13.03.2017,13.03.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/22577_en,http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/g2/market_test.pdf,"The European Commission invites comments from all interested parties on commitments submitted by Gazprom to address the Commission's competition concerns as regards gas markets in Central and Eastern Europe. The commitments will enable cross-border gas flows at competitive prices. Commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager , said: ""We believe that Gazprom's commitments will enable the free flow of gas in Central and Eastern Europe at competitive prices. They address our competition concerns and provide a forward looking solution in line with EU rules. In fact, they help to better integrate gas markets in the region. This matters to millions of Europeans that rely on gas to heat their homes and fuel their businesses. We now want to hear the views of customers and other stakeholders and will carefully consider them before taking any decision.""  Gazprom is the dominant gas supplier in a number of Central and Eastern European countries. In April 2015, the Commission sent a Statement of Objections expressing its preliminary view that Gazprom had been breaking EU antitrust rules by pursuing an overall strategy to partition Central and Eastern European gas markets. In the Commission's view, the commitments offered by Gazprom cover its competition concerns. They help to better integrate Central and Eastern European gas markets, facilitating cross-border gas flows at competitive prices. In particular, the Commission considers that Gazprom's commitments meet its objectives regarding each of the competition concerns, namely by ensuring that: The Commission now invites all stakeholders to submit their views on the commitments within seven weeks of their publication in the Official Journal. Taking into account all comments received, the Commission will then take a final view as to whether the commitments are a satisfactory way of addressing the Commission's competition concerns. If this is the case, the Commission may adopt a decision making the commitments legally binding on Gazprom (under Article 9 of the EU's antitrust Regulation 1/2003). If a company breaks such commitments, the Commission can impose a fine of up to 10% of the company's worldwide turnover, without having to prove an infringement of the EU antitrust rules. More generally, effective competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets does not only depend on the enforcement of EU competition rules but also on investment in gas supply diversification, well-targeted European and national energy legislation and their proper implementation. This is why it is a key priority of the Commission to build a European Energy Union . Details on Gazprom's commitments The Commission's Statement of Objections set out three main competition concerns. Gazprom's commitments respond to these concerns. It has committed to observe the commitments for eight years.  1) Enabling the free flow of gas in Central and Eastern Europe The Commission has concerns that Gazprom imposed territorial restrictions in its supply agreements with wholesalers and some industrial customers in eight Member States ( Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia ). These restrictions prevent the free trade of gas within Central and Eastern Europe. Gazprom has committed to remove all contractual barriers to the free flow of gas in Central and Eastern European gas markets. In addition, it has committed to take active steps to enable their better integration :  2) Ensuring competitive gas prices in Central and Eastern Europe The Commission has been concerned that the territorial restrictions have allowed Gazprom to carve up the market, as a result of which it may have been able to pursue an excessive pricing policy in five Member States ( Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland ). Gazprom has committed to introduce a number of important changes to its contractual price revision clauses to ensure competitive gas prices in these gas markets:  3) Removing demands obtained through its dominant market position Finally, the Commission has concerns that Gazprom leveraged its dominant market position on the gas supply market to obtain advantages relating to access to or control of gas infrastructure . The Statement of Objections raised concerns in relation to the South Stream project in Bulgaria and the Yamal pipeline in Poland. As regards the Yamal Pipeline, the Commission's investigation has shown that the situation cannot be changed by this antitrust procedure due to the impact of an intergovernmental agreement between Poland and Russia. To better deal with future international agreements, the Commission has put forward in February 2016 a legislative proposal to make intergovernmental agreements subject to prior scrutiny by the Commission. The proposal has been adopted by the European Parliament on 2 March 2017 and is now pending with the Council (see also the Commission press release welcoming the political agreement reached in December 2016). Please also see country-specific Factsheets that explain how the commitments would benefit each Member State concerned: Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Hungary and Slovakia . The full text of the commitments is also available on the Commission's Competition website. A summary of the proposed commitments will be published in the EU's Official Journal. More information is available on the Commission's Competition website , in the public case register under the case number 39816 . Bruxelles"

WTO confirms Russian pork ban is illegal,27.02.2017,27.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/21431_en,,"The WTO’s Appellate Body confirmed on 23 February 2017 that Russia’s import bans on live pigs, pork and other pig products from the EU is illegal under international trade rules. The ruling concerns a ban imposed by Russia in January 2014 because of the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in areas in the EU close to the border with Belarus. In an earlier ruling of 19 August 2016, a WTO panel acknowledged that Russia's refusal to accept imports of certain EU products and to adapt EU-Russia health import certificates accordingly amounts to an EU-wide import ban. The Russian measure is not based on the relevant international standards and violates the rules of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). The panel made the same criticism of individual Russian bans on imports from Poland, Lithuania, and Estonia. The ruling of 23 February sends another strong signal to Russia and all WTO Members on their obligation to respect international standards and to adapt their measures to respect the principle of Regionalization (Art.6 of the WTO-SPS Agreement). The panel underlined that WTO Members can exercise their right to determine their appropriate levels of sanitary protection and to restrict imports on the basis of sanitary concerns as long as they are effectively responding to real sanitary risks. This does not, therefore, concern products coming from disease-free areas. The EU has one of the world's most efficient animal health and food safety systems, including high detection levels and stringent risk management rules. The ruling of 23 February reconfirms that the measures taken by Russia against the EU have little to do with any real sanitary or health risks. EU products from disease-free areas are safe and there is thus no need for any country to maintain unjustified import restrictions. Russia should withdraw its unjustified measures and allow EU companies to resume normal business with their Russian partners. For most of the products dealt with in this case, trade continues to be restricted by a politically motivated ban Russia imposed on EU agri-food products in August 2014. However, certain products such as pig fat, offal and live animals for breeding were covered by the sanitary ban addressed by the WTO and are outside the scope of the 2014 political ban. The EU will continue to use WTO procedures to ensure that international trade rules are effectively respected. WTO dispute settlement remains the strongest option to tackle significant trade barriers and to thus increase legal certainty and predictability for our companies. Protectionist policies by Russia affect a wide variety of other economic sectors. In the recent past, the WTO panel rulings sided with the EU contesting a number of trade barriers imposed by Russia: excess duties on paper and other products and antidumping duties on light commercial vehicles. The EU has also initiated a WTO procedure on Russia's recycling fees on cars; this procedure is still pending. Background Trade facts and figures Total trade between the EU and Russia fell by around 36 % in the period 2013-2015. Nevertheless, the EU remains by far Russia’s most important trading partner: in 2015, the EU exported to Russia goods worth €74 billion and imported products worth nearly €139 billion. While Russian exports to the EU consist mainly of energy and raw materials, EU exports to Russia are mostly vehicles, medicines, machinery and transport equipment, as well as agricultural products. The EU represents about 40% of total Russian exports (2015). Russia accounts for less than 6% of EU's global trade and less than 4% of EU exports.

Protectionist policies by Russia affect a wide variety of other economic sectors. In the recent past, the WTO panel rulings sided with the EU contesting a number of trade barriers imposed by Russia: excess duties on paper and other products and antidumping duties on light commercial vehicles. The EU has also initiated a WTO procedure on Russia's recycling fees on cars; this procedure is still pending.  Background Trade facts and figures Total trade between the EU and Russia fell by around 36 % in the period 2013-2015. Nevertheless, the EU remains by far Russia’s most important trading partner: in 2015, the EU exported to Russia goods worth €74 billion and imported products worth nearly €139 billion. While Russian exports to the EU consist mainly of energy and raw materials, EU exports to Russia are mostly vehicles, medicines, machinery and transport equipment, as well as agricultural products. The EU represents about 40% of total Russian exports (2015). Russia accounts for less than 6% of EU's global trade and less than 4% of EU exports.

Speech by Ambassador Fabrizi at the Australian Institute of International Affairs,21.02.2017,21.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/21010_en,,"The European Union's Ambassador to Australia H.E. Sem Fabrizi, delivered a speech at the Australian Institute of International Affairs on 2017 - An important year for the EU. (Canberra, 14 February). Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the ACT Branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs for giving me the opportunity to share my take on how the EU is approaching this still rather new and challenging year of 2017. Allow me also to mention that the AIIA (National level) and the EU Delegation are partnering to organise the first ever European Union and Australia Leadership Forum this June in Sydney that will bring together leaders from the business, political, academic, NGO and media sectors to explore how the EU and Australia can best approach the challenges and opportunities of our times. Tonight's address is entitled:  2017: an important year for the EU – increased responsibilities and challenges in a contested scenario. I plan to develop my argument in three steps: - first of all an increased sense of responsibility – to defend the rule-based international order that is coming under increasing pressure; increased responsibility also to promote the interests and the values of EU citizens; - secondly , the challenges that the EU is facing internationally by mass migration, climate change, regional insecurity to its East and the South; and domestically by populist forces who exploits the slow economic recovery and the terrorist threat; - thirdly the o pportunities that arise for the EU in addressing these challenges, while holding its values and principles.  1) Responsibilities in a contested world We live in times when fundamental norms and principles of international cooperation and engagement are increasingly contested .  Be it the principle of territorial integrity (as in the case Ukraine); be it the rules based international order that frames climate action, free trade, migration, non-proliferation, human rights and international organisations – the UN, WTO, International court of Justice – which underpin this system. Be it our sense of community challenged by t errorism.  There are an increasing number of actors around the globe, who believe and act as if this rules based order does no longer serve the purpose of its ultimate objective which is to frame the quest for peace and prosperity of the international community.  Those who still hold these principles very dear - and the EU and Australia do - have an increased responsibility to stand up, defend and uphold them.  The EU believes that the best way to do this is via multilateralism and a liberal global political and economic order remains valid.  We will continue to support the importance of promoting Human Rights, peaceful conflict resolution, the benefits of free movement of goods, services and people and the need to preserve the planet.  We want to continue engaging with our international partners and allies, based on the understanding that multilateralism has proven to be an effective method to mitigate differences and shape consensus.  We will continue to support the institutions created to underpin the global rule based order: the UN, the WTO, the UNFCCC, the International Criminal Court to name just a few.  This leads me to elaborate further on the key challenges we are facing – globally and, more specifically, in Europe:  Challenges  Challenges, these days, are not in short supply.  Internationally  Migration : We witness an unprecedented number of people on the move internationally (UN estimates around 60 million). Many of those are ready to risk everything, even their life to come to Europe. This has resulted in a true migration-crisis over the past year creating enormous challenges for our European immigration and asylum systems and our weaknesses.  Terrorism : Around the world we have seen over the past few years a worrying surge of terrorist activities, particularly fuelled by religious extremism. No country or region seems to be spared.  Regional Instability : The illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia and the continuing destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine remains a threat to the security and prosperity of the EU.  As is the continuing conflict in Syria and the persisting instability in countries like Libya .  Even the tensions in the South China Sea or the risks created by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in like DPRK represent challenges we all have to face.  Domestic challenges;  - the underperformance of European economies following the global financial crisis which brought unacceptable rates of unemployment and the migration consequences has fuelled populists forces whose political offer is based on simplistic recipes: national egoism, fears.  In the UK , the majority of people were not convinced after the bitterly fought campaign that the UK would be better off inside the EU rather than outside. And Brexit is a serious challenge to the European integration process. Not only will the UK be the first country to ever leave the European Union in its 60 years of history – it has also galvanised the attention of those in other EU member states who don't think the EU is part of the solution – but rather part of the problem.  The upcoming elections in the Netherlands in France and in Germany later this year will show whether the challenges for the EU will deepen further this year. Opportunities  With all these serious challenges in front of us, let me turn to the opportunities that the EU is seizing when approaching challenges.   1) The terrorist attacks have led to an aggressive anti-terrorism strategy with a substantial strengthening of our internal and external security in the European Union. The EU counter-terrorism strategy aims to combat terrorism globally while respecting human rights, the cooperation between our Member States has strongly increased and we have put in place new legislation strengthening external borders, improving transport security improving practical cooperation and information exchange between police and judicial authorities, tackling terrorist financing and depriving terrorists of the means by which they mount attacks and communicate (PNR, ESDA, system, finger printing etc.), in full respect of civil liberties, privacy and protection of human rights.  2) An effective Migration policy . We have put in place a common European Coast Guard, launched several maritime missions that have rescued more than 400,000 people.  The arrangements we have put in place with Turkey have helped to return to a more manageable flow of migrants via the so-called Balkan route. We have contributed to the disruption of organised people smuggling syndicates including by working with the Libyan authorities. Again in doing this we have been very clear that the European Union will stand for those who have the right to international protection. 3) A global foreign and security policy. The EU Global Strategy calls for a stronger Europe to act as a security provider in this contested global scenario, based on innovative principles such as ""principled pragmatism"" and ""strategic autonomy"" to make possible for the EU to intervene, engage, in a united, responsible approach in partnership with others, including our like-minded partners, like Australia.  Over the past months the focus has been on implementing the Strategy’s security and defence plan which has already produced significant results in equipping the EU to respond more rapidly and decisively to external conflicts, strengthening the EU–NATO strategic partnership and supporting the industrial basis for European defence such as investing in the European Defence supply chain.  4) An open trade policy. Trade provides the opportunity for countries, particularly in Europe, to come together and benefit. Recently the EU's trade commissioner, Cecilia Maelstrom, declared ""trade is worth fighting for"". This is why we are making good progress in talks with Japan, and with the Mercosur countries in South America, restarting last year after a long pause. This week the European Parliament is expected to vote through the Canadian-EU free trade deal. And of course we plan to open formal FTA negotiations with Australia still this year. This is how we embrace the opportunities for further trade liberalisation in order to deliver greater economic benefits to our citizens.  5) A sustained, inclusive and resilient economic recovery . I will not detail the enormous efforts that the EU and its MS have achieved over the past few years through a combination of structural reforms, monetary policy and EU wide measures. Only yesterday, the European Commission presented the economic winter forecasts: for the first time in nearly a decade all the 28 MS are expected to grow throughout the entire forecasting period (2016 – EZ 2017 +1,6%  2018 + 1,8% ); real GDP has grown in EZ for 15 consecutive quarters, employment is growing, unemployment falling (8,5% in 2016; 8,1% 2017; 7,8% in 2018), private consumption is leading. Inflation is picking up. All parameters are positive. However the outlook is surrounded by higher than usual uncertainty.  Conclusions:  It is clear that a sense of complacency on the future of the EU is out of place, but pessimism, too.  History is on our side. We have delivered the longest, safest secure and more prosperous period of peace in Europe. I agree that looking back is not enough, but amnesia does not help when looking forward.  It is also clear that in this global contested scenario, where the EU shoulders have increased responsibilities and challenges, a 'business as usual approach' is not enough.  The EU and its Member States need courage and a clear vision for their common future as they realise that no single EU country can face and solve the many threats in front of us.  This is how the EU approaches the challenges and opportunities of 2017 - the year in which the EU will celebrate the 60 th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome which created the European Economic Community back in the 1950s.  It is more than just a birthday to celebrate. It is a stepping stone for the future, an occasion to re-define our vision of a unified European continent and the future of the European Union – even after the UK has left.  We have the vision, we have the capacity, we have the resources, and we have the people to give a common response to global challenges.  As president Tusk recently said at the European Council in Malta - Europe is strongest when united: United we stand, divided we fall.   Canberra"
EU announces €18 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine,20.02.2017,20.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20939_en,http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/ukraine_en.pdf,"Today Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides has announced additional funding for people affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine during his visit to the country. ""The recent escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine, and its impact on the civilian population, is of great concern. Here today in Bakhmut , I want to tell the Ukrainian people: you are not alone. All civilians in need must be helped, on both sides of the contact line. Our new aid package will help humanitarian partners in eastern Ukraine to cover urgent medical, shelter, water and sanitation needs. It is crucial that aid gets to all vulnerable people affected by the conflict swiftly, safely and impartially."" said Commissioner Christos Stylianides . The European Commission provides humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable communities, irrespective of which area of the conflict they live in or have fled to. Around 50% of the Commission's humanitarian assistance targets people in need in non-government controlled areas. Together with the funding provided directly by the Member States, the EU as a whole has directed over €399 million in humanitarian and recovery aid to those affected by the conflict since early 2014.  Background: An estimated 2.8 million people are displaced and in need of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The complex crisis in eastern Ukraine has a dramatic impact on the population affected and with negative consequences for neighbouring countries. The recent escalation of violence in the Donbas shows the conflict is far from being solved. Heavy fighting in the vicinity of Adviivka on 29 January-5 February has resulted in 17,000 residents without water, electricity and heating for almost a week. Since the resurgence of violence, the EU has been providing support through its humanitarian partners that are delivering their assistance to the residents of Avdiivka and other recently affected areas. The provided aid includes drinking water, fuel, candles, torches, mattresses, winter clothing, construction materials, drugs and medical equipment. The Commission is also assisting Ukrainian refugees in Belarus and Russia through the national Red Cross Societies in the respective countries. All EU humanitarian assistance is based solely on the needs of the affected populations. Humanitarian needs : People living in the non-government controlled areas and on both sides of the line of contact, returnees, refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) face shortages of essentials such as food, medicine and health care, basic household items, clean water and shelter. Basic services are not available in all areas as a result of damage to the infrastructure, electricity grid and water supply systems and increase of market prices. Who benefits: The EU's humanitarian aid goes to the people affected by the conflict, living in the non-government controlled areas and on both sides of the line of contact to refugees and to internally displaced people who have fled the conflict areas, as well as to returnees. EU humanitarian aid is often distributed in the form of cash and vouchers, allowing maximum efficiency and preserving the dignity of the affected people. The recipients can buy essential items at the local shops and markets, thus supporting the local economy.

Speech by Federica Mogherini at the Munich Security Conference,18.02.2017,18.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20832_en,,"Speech by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini during the panel 'The Transatlantic Relationship and the International Order' at the 53rd Munich Security Conference Check against delivery! First of all, for me it is really a pleasure to be back in the Munich Security Conference and let me tell you how pleased I am to speak just after Jens [Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General] but also just after António [Guterres, UN Secretary General]. It fits perfectly well to highlight the wonderful cooperation the European Union has with NATO, with the UN and, by the way, with many other international organisations and partners. We indeed live in very dangerous and confused times and in a world that seems to go in a direction that is not reassuring to many of our citizens, if not to all of our citizens. I remember very well exactly two years ago here in Munich, I announced that the European Union was going to work on a new Global Strategy. That was far before the US elections, before the UK referendum, before the turmoil we are now seeing in the world. I would like, by the way, to thank many in this room who have worked on that strategy. And a few elements of the Strategy that we now share at 28 – because I would like to stress that we are still 28 and we will be still 28 at least for a couple of years – is that power is indeed diffused: we are far from unilateralism and unipolarism and we are far also from multipolarism. We are actually in a state of confusion where the power stands, who has the power today in the world. But, also, we live in a world where rules are perceived increasingly as a constraint for one; one be it one country, one group, one individual rather than a guarantee for all and this is a major challenge of our global order. And we live in times that in the Global Strategy we define as times of “predictable unpredictability” and I guess we were quite right in analysing these trends. In this dangerous and confused times where our citizens feel exposed to dangers, where does the European Union stand? Allow me to surprise you because I know that you are used to associate the word 'European Union' to the word 'crisis'. It is at least a couple of years we do that. Let me bring here the voice of a proud European: I believe that in the state of the world that we live in today, the European Union is quite in a good place. I say this because I have the privilege of seeing the European Union through the eyes of our partners around the world; from Japan to Argentina, from Canada to South Africa. And I think out of these experiences, that the European Union is much, much stronger that we Europeans realise and it is much more indispensable to Europeans and to the world than we realise most of the times. Because seen from the outside the European Union is a reliable, predictable, strong, cooperative partner for many in the world. I would say a point of reference when it comes to multilateralism, free and fair trade, human rights and rule of law, economic development, SDGs – and I could continue -, fight against climate change. Look at us from the outside - it should be the same also from the inside. The European Union is the biggest market in the world, including for US goods; it is the first humanitarian donor worldwide; it is the first provider of development assistance; it is the first trade partner for most of the countries and regions in the world; it is the second world economy – there are fights ongoing on who is the first; it is a major political and diplomatic power with 140 delegations of the European Union around the world coordinating the work of 28 embassies of our Member States, in countries and in international organisations starting from the United Nations; and it is a security provider, globally. Jens was mentioning the cooperation we have. NATO and the European Union in the last seven months have developed 42 common concrete projects from cyber to maritime cooperation and we are implementing them hand-in-hand. We are different organisations, we have different members – many of them are the same, but not all completely -; we have different mandates: NATO is a military alliance, the European Union is a regional integration project. But there is a lot we are already doing together and this is only one part of how the European Union is a security provider in the world. The Chancellor [of Germany, Angela Merkel] was mentioning today that the European Union has 15 military and civilian operations and missions around the world, from Africa to the Mediterranean. If in half of the Horn of Africa we do not see piracy anymore is thanks to us and the list could continue. But there is one more thing – let me be very open and clear here: the 2% debate on the defence spending is a NATO debate and it is for member states or allies in NATO to define their way. But if the European countries want to spend more and better, the only way in which they can do that is through the European Union. Because when it comes to spending together it is the European Union that can provide the Member States the incentives to do so, be it on innovation, on research, on capability development and we are putting in place a European defence fund that will support exactly this cooperative defence spending to fill the gap not only – or not so much – on the investments, but on the outpout. Jens is very well aware of what I am saying because we go around as a couple for many months and we send similar messages so he heard this many times. What worries me the most is not the fact that Europeans spend 50% of what Americans spend in defence – that is half of it. What worries me the most is that the European output in defence is 15%, which means that we have to work on the economy scale and the way in which we can work on the economy of scale is through our European Union instruments. So you want to increase the effectiveness of what you call burden sharing, I would call as a European the responsibility sharing for global security, then the instruments lie in the European Union as well. But this means that the European Union is working to do more on its defence as European Union – not to mix with the NATO one – because it is European Union's citizens priority number one. We have seen for seven, eight, nine years the priority number one for our citizens was economy. Now we see it is security. We need to do that for ourselves not because someone asked us to do that as Europeans. We will do more in the European Union and this will help also NATO. But let me add also one other question that is profoundly a European Union question: having said that we will do more, are we sure that simply doing more would make it? Are we sure that more of the same is what we need? I am not so sure. I am not sure because security challenges today - and António Guterres was saying this a few moments ago -, security challenges today cannot really be faced effectively today with a purely and exclusively military approach. We see that. We see that every day, be it in the terrorist threats, be it in the cyber attacks. Are we sure that is only through increasing military capabilities that we will make it? And here, again, you need the European Union, because when you invest in development, when you invest in the fight against climate change, you also invest in our own security. And, finally, I believe Europeans are understanding that investing in strong societies – and in strong societies, not in the illusion that a strong man – and always a man – makes a country stable -, in resilience, in human rights, democracy, good governance, jobs, education… investing in this, which is the European way, is also an investment in our security. It is not only the European way, I am looking at my friend from Canada and I know it is also the Canadian way and many others in the world. But this combined approach when you have the soft and the hard power together and you do it the smart way, I think it is the way and the only way to face our security challenges today. It is not charity: investing in development, investing in the Sustainable Development Goals, investing in humanitarian [aid], is not charity. It is an investment, a selfish investment, in our security. I do not know if this is something we share with all our partners in the world. I know this is the European way: friendship, partnership, with many – starting from the United States, I think this is a friendship that will stay, it is much deeper that any change in an administration and politics. Let me also say that for Europeans the transatlantic friendships and partnerships go beyond the friendship we have with the United States. It belongs also to our Canadian friends, to our Mexican friends, to the whole Latin America which is also for us across the Atlantic. And it means that we will continue to invest in partnerships and cooperation with all the other partners we have around the world, be them countries, be them other regional organisations – from the African Union to the League of Arab States -, and investing in a strong UN system. The European Union is and will continue to be the first supporter of this multilateral approach and obviously we will continue working with NATO. So, we will continue on this way. I think we will need to change a lot of things inside the European Union, but outside, in the world, the European Union will for sure be a more indispensable partner than before and I would say a more indispensable power than before. In the confusion we are facing, you can be sure that the European Union will remain a stable, reliable, predictable partner for many and for security in the sense of a collective security based on cooperation. This is the way we are working, this is the way the world can count on us to continue to work. Thank you. Q&A Q. On the conflict in Ukraine. In every panel we discuss about security in Europe and everybody understands that without referring to the situation in Ukraine we can't talk about stability in Europe, because Ukraine is one of the largest countries in Europe and instability in Ukraine can bring instability to the whole region. We heard today the position on Ukraine from the Vice President of the US, Mike Pence, from Chancellor Angela Merkel. Everybody understands it is not a civil war as explained in some news. Everybody understands that without weapon delivering, financial support and propaganda, this conflict would have never ever ended. It is a more political question. And there are not good results. Every day people die in the conflict zone. What do you think about having the United States in the Normandy format together with France, Germany and Russia? FM. Thank you for the question and also for the part that preceded the question. Because indeed I think that our focus has to stay on the situation in Ukraine. That is also part of my talks in Washington when I was visiting our friends from the new US administration last week. It is extremely important for the European Union to constantly raise this issue to make sure that we have an international unity around the implementation of the Minsk agreements. For us, as you know well, and I constantly work together with President [of Ukraine, Petro] Poroshenko, with Prime Minister [of Ukraine, Volodymyr] Groysman and with many of the ministers as well in Ukraine, to try and to support and you know that the European Union is supporting the country in many different ways. For us what is essential is that the Minsk agreements can be fully implemented. We have, as you know, sanctions in place on Russia both for the illegal annexation of Crimea and for the situation in the east of Ukraine, for the conflict in the east of Ukraine and these sanctions are clearly linked to the fully implementation of the Minsk agreements. And this is going to stay in the European Union as our position. The point though is, for me, not the issue of keeping or not the sanctions. The point, for me, is improving or solving the situation in the east of Ukraine and implementing fully the Minsk agreements. On the format, I have stopped quite early on in my job to focus too much on the formats of the meetings and try to focus on the substance of the outcome. I know that most of the times this is what we spend time on; I think that times do not allow us to define this as a priority. I think that the priority is how the European Union – possibly with others -, but how the European Union – I speak for ourselves – can do more to help all to implement fully the Minsk agreements. We are working on some ideas, we are discussing these ideas both with the French and the Germans and mainly with the Ukrainian government and with our Russian friends to see how we can do more to make sure that the Minsk agreements are implemented. As you know the commitment is there. The format is facing some challenges in these times. We are ready to help, to support, to accompany, provided that this is for the sake of the substance and not for the sake of the discussion on the format. We are not looking for a place in a ministerial photo. We are looking for substance and results and for us that is what counts: that the conflict in the east of Ukraine ends. Q. Basically the efficiency of the defence spending, especially in investments in Europe can only be improved substantially if we do away with the principle of juste retour, eg you get back accordingly to the money you spend. As long as we do that, we will be as inefficient as we are today. Because do you see any chance that the European [Member] States are willing to concentrate for certain activities in one company, in Europe, as we see effectively in the United States or you see that is not realistic chance in the near future? FM. I think there is a chance; more than a chance. And this is exactly the work we started to do in the last six, seven months. It started in August – not the most popular month to start such a heavy work for my staff - but I think it was right to do it quite quickly focusing on the very beginning of this which is investments in research, innovation, on capability developments and working on this cooperative approach, facilitating and incentivising the Member States of the European Union, with European Union instruments, to work together from the early stages to the outcome, to the output. I believe this is the right way to go and I see the space to do so. Why? Because there is now a combined need, on one side, the need to work more on defence, for the European Member States, because, again, it is a priority for our citizens and, on the other side, the need to square the circle with the budgets. The national budgets are put to test after so many years of economic crisis and some other priorities that the only way to do that is to do that together. And I see that there is a window also because Jens often makes this example of the frigate. If Norway and Spain were producing the frigate together, he would not have faced any problems of re-election probably, so it is also a matter of sustainability in terms of producing more European projects and sustaining them. We already have the European Defence Agency that is doing that but we can put - I was mentioning the European Defence Fund - money to support this work and this is going to make the real difference in European Defence. I know this was the last question, but I would like to add one thing if I can. Can I? Thanks. Because I was mentioning the fact that we are linked across the Atlantic with our friends in the United States not only by gratitude which is reciprocal – and as an Italian, or as German this goes without saying, and we heard [the US] Vice-President [Mike] Pence saying that this is also a gratitude that in the United States they feel for what we have done in Afghanistan and elsewhere - but it is also economy that links us. I was looking at the numbers: 80 per cent - eighty! - of direct foreign investments in the United States is generated by the European Union. There are 15 million jobs that depend on our economic relation across the Atlantic and half of them are in the United States. So if you look at every single state in the United States, there are hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on our economic cooperation. So when we see that Europe needs America, it is also America that needs Europe and I think we have to be very careful on how we handle this cooperation and this partnership in the months ahead. Thanks. Munich"

Federica Mogherini"" at the Atlantic Council",13.02.2017,13.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20470_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the public event ""A Conversation with H.E. Federica Mogherini"" at the Atlantic Council Washington, 10 February 2017 Check against delivery! President and CEO of the Atlantic Council, Mr Fred Kempe (FK): You said your mission for this trip was to identify common ground. We have heard comments from the administration and during the campaign that question at times the existence of the European Union, but also we at the Atlantic Council have heard quite the opposite as well in our dealings with people within the administration. After your meetings here in Washington, D.C. over the last two days – impressive: seven Senators; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; the National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and others - which I think underscores the importance that the leaders of this Administration accord this relationship but I wasn't in the meetings. So it would be really interesting for us to hear what your takeaways were. What did you hear that was reassuring? What did you hear that leaves questions? Are you returning to Europe changed in any of your views? More optimistic? Less so? I would love to hear your trip report. High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini (FM): Thank you. Well, first of all, thank you for the invitation and it is really like being home. I was afraid you were going to say ""my home away from home"" and as I am confused if my home now is Rome or Brussels that would have been a challenge in itself. But indeed for me it is home and I was just remembering the first time I came to the Atlantic Council: I was still a member of the Italian Parliament in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and this was already, back then, my home, away from Europe. So, it is great to be here and thanks for having me here. And thanks to all of you for coming. I came here with a certain dose of optimism already, so I do not have to change my mind on that. I said I was coming first of all to show that on the European side, there is a strong and deep belief in the fact that across the Atlantic, we are friends. Our peoples are friends; they also do a lot of things together from trade and investment to foreign policy and security work. And also to reach out at an early stage to the new Administration, and also with Congress - and that is why so many meetings on the Hill - because it seems to me that in this moment we need to talk from our European side to the different interlocutors in the US institutions in these days. And I will come back from this trip with a positive impression. You were not in the meetings but I can tell you that they were all good, very good. I do not know what the next tweet would be about but my meetings were excellent so what I am receiving as a message is first of a great attention from my interlocutors in Washington to the work of the European Union and a clear message: we want to continue working together. And this is the same message that I am bringing here. So, all good. FK: The one name I failed to mention in listing your meetings was Jared Kushner, Special Advisor to the President. He is also taking on quite a bit of responsibility for the Middle East. I do not expect you to reveal confidences and private conversations but in these meetings did you get a feeling of what the priorities would be for the administration, or any of the individuals you talk to, in the EU relationship if you were 'tiering' them? FM: Well, first of all, one of the purposes of these meetings were also, from my side, to make clear which priorities we have in Europe and that was, I think, important to do at an early stage, because it seems to me that policies in Washington in this moment are still in the making, and that we have space for defining together at an early stage, in a very pragmatic manner, in which fields we will have a common approach or a common interest, or a common priority, and in which other fields or files we might have a different approach, different priorities. Something can be very important for us and less important here [in the US]; or on some other issues we might disagree. I have the impression that - before I said ""all good"", meaning that all meetings were good and all messages were good - but I would not pretend that we do not have different views on some issues. So what I can tell you is where European priorities are and where I see where common ground can be found and maybe some other issues where we have different approaches. I see, first of all, common ground in the strong intention to work together. If I have to believe in all the messages that I have heard during my meetings, that is clear to me: continued cooperation, strong US-EU cooperation and work; understanding well, I think - and I hope that I contributed to this understanding in these two days - that the European Union is not an institution, it is 28 Member States. Second, some common ground on some of our priorities that are common priorities: the fight against terrorism - Ambassador [Kristen Silverberg, Managing Director, Institute of International Finance; Former Ambassador of the United States to the European Union] was mentioning this -; solving some of the crises we have around us and globally - the situation in the east of Ukraine, Syria, terrorism, not only in the Middle East, but also spreading in some parts of Africa. We have, for sure, work that we can do together there. We have on the European side top priorities where we might find some different views across the Atlantic today. How we face the Middle East Peace Process? I think there we share the priority, we might have some differences on how we face them - and as you can see, I am very open and not hiding any of the difficulties - and we might have some other issues where we see, as Europeans, that we need to put these issues as a priority and maybe here [in the US] not so much: climate change, multilateralism, free trade, free and fair trade and an international global system of trade, maybe some human rights issues. But it is not for me to define the American agenda that I understand is still in the making. What I can do it is to bring the European agenda, put it on the table and in a very pragmatic, open, constructive, friendly, maybe transactional approach, see where we can work together, where we might have differences, and how we make the most out of this partnership. Among the things on which we might have different views, there is the global approach to migration and refugees and again, the list could continue. But I see space for common ground, I see space for common work and I understand that many policies are still in the making. I forgot to mention one very important thing, on which I found some common ground, which is the nuclear deal with Iran – the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). For me, that was a priority, that is a priority to preserve the deal, have a strong US commitment to its full implementation, which means strict - an implementation is either in place or not - so one hundred percent, and on this I come back with some reassurances. FK: I saw you tweet that earlier… FM: I also tweet and I also do it myself! FK: So even more room for common ground! FM: Definitely so! Even if I am considering to make my team check my tweets before I send them out! FK: I won't comment on that! Maybe we can talk a bit about the Iran conversation - what did you hear there that you found reassuring ? FM: I have heard from all my interlocutors the intention to make sure that the deal is one hundred percent implemented. This requires all parties, which means mainly Iran on its nuclear commitments but also the international community to fulfil the commitments that are agreed in the deal. And for me personally, this is a very important thing to do because I still have a special institutional role in chairing the Joint Commission that overviews the implementation of the deal, which is not a bilateral deal, which is now belonging to the international community through the UN Security Council Resolution that endorses it. And as a European, it was important for me to pass here the message that I think was clearly understood, that it is key for our security, as we are in the same region with Iran, to see the deal implemented, as it is being now - because one year after the implementation day we have had four IAEA ¬¬[International Atomic Energy Agency] reports on its full implementation on the nuclear-related commitments of Iran. This is important for Europe; this is essential for Europe. Then there are other issues where we share concerns with the US administration and with many others in the world, that are not related to the nuclear programme of Iran, not related to the nuclear agreement, the role of Iran in some regional conflicts, starting from Yemen or Syria, support to terrorist activities, the missile tests and things like that. I would add, as a European, humans rights and death penalty – I know this is a different story maybe here but for us it is really an important point. And as Europeans, we do have our sanctions in place for non-nuclear related issues with Iran and in some cases our sanctions are tougher than the American ones. So, we also are concerned about some other things. But what is clear to us, as Europeans, all together, and what I also conveyed here in my meetings, is that Europe feels an interest and a responsibility to engage with Iran. Especially as long as the nuclear deal is fully implemented on their side, on their nuclear commitments, we will continue to engage with Iran, be it on economic relations, be it in political dialogue, be it in the sectorial dialogues and cooperation we have started. I know this is not the US policy, but this is the European policy and this will continue. So, we have on one side, the full implementation of the JCPOA, where I have seen here a certain degree of commitment, to stick to that; [and on the other,] our common concerns on non-nuclear related issues on the role of Iran and where we have different policies, but that was the case also with the previous administration. The European way - as has always been the case with Iran - is one of engagement and that will continue. And I think it is very important that Iranians, that the Iranian citizens hear this from Europe in these days. FK: Thank you for that. On Russia. We have heard different statements at different times from the administration, from the President. The administration most recently signalled the US sanctions against Russia would remain in place. On the other hand there seems to be a desire to significantly improve the relationship with Russia. To the extent you can, how did this come up in your conversations and where do you see potential commonalities and differences on the issue of Russia, particularly Ukraine? FM: You know it is quite weird. It is the first time I come to Washington and rather than being questioned on the EU's positions on Russia, on Syria or whatever, I am questioned about the US's positions. It is ok. I will try my best! FK: Yes, could you please tell us what the US's position is? (Laughs) FM: I am not sure I can! No, on some things I do, I am not sure it is appropriate for me to be the spokesperson but that is an interesting experience. It is also the first time that the main focus of my visit to Washington is bilateral relations rather than some of the crises we have around us, and this is telling us the new era we are entering in. On Russia, first of all, for Europeans, it is clear: we have a two-track policy with Russia. There are files on which we work very well with Russia: the Iran deal was a perfect example of that; the Middle East Peace Process - Israel-Palestine is another example where the Europeans and the Russians work well together within the Quartet, we have similar views; other issues where we work a lot and well together. So this perception that Europe doesn't talk to Russia is a misperception and, by the way, a couple of years ago I would have been asked if we were not talking too much to the Russians so things change in an interesting manner. We have a strong policy and principled policy when it comes to Ukraine. This is very serious to us. Not only for the situation in the east of Ukraine itself and in Crimea but also because for us Europeans it is essential to understand each other, especially across the Atlantic, on the basic, vital principle that you do not change borders by force. And this, for us, is a must of our cooperation. Across the Atlantic, this has never been put into question and I believe this is related not only to the principles of international law - which it is - but also it is a matter of security for Europe and I believe that many of my fellow European citizens in the East of our continent are potentially a bit nervous about question marks that could be put here on this approach. Also on this, my meetings were positive and in particular we agreed that as long as the Minsk agreements are not fully implemented, sanctions will remain in place. But I do not know if this is going to be the consolidated policy and as you were not in my meetings I was not in the Oval Office when President Trump called President Putin. But for us this is an essential point and I believe that this is not only an essential point for Europeans, I think that in Congress this is an essential point as well. FK:  If there is a thaw of some sort in relationships between the US and Russia - which is a possibility, even if sanctions should remain in place - do you foresee that the EU Member States will have the resolve to remain firm on sanctions under the current set of circumstances where Minsk has not been implemented and Crimea is still occupied ? FM: I think Europeans will continue to be united on that. I do not know if Americans will be united on that, but Europeans will. For us - I want to be clear also on this - for us the sanctions are not a policy in itself. It is not something we take particular pleasure in having. For us it is an instrument to put pressure and achieve the result, and for us the result is not keeping the sanctions; for us, the result is solving the conflict in Ukraine. So, we also discussed, especially with Secretary Tillerson, how we can better support, or help, the full implementation of the Minsk agreements and this is perfectly fine because the real objective is this: to achieve peace in the east of Ukraine, respect of international law, and also in Crimea. So, again, the European position is clear on this. I am confident it will continue to be clear, in unity, because all those who, over years, have bet on Europeans to divide themselves on this have been wrong and I think this will continue to be the case, but I cannot answer for the US. I can say I was receiving reassuring messages, but I do not know if there will be divisions in the US on this. I hope not. FK: Thank you for that. I am going to ask one or two more questions and then go to the audience. You have said that the EU is ready for a transactional way of working with the United States – your words in the past, and also today. I guess, at the Atlantic Council, the notion of a transactional relationship for the transatlantic partners would seem a step backwards. So do you think that this is sufficient, and what do you mean when you say a transactional way of working with the United States? FM: You know I have the feeling that this is a moment in history where we have to avoid taking it for granted that people understand the added value of our friendship; which is sad, I agree. I prefer to have a partnership, a friendship based on this automatic reflex we have had in these last years of turning to each other and agreeing things to do, naturally. But if there is the need to recall the need for a friendship to be in place, the added value of the European Union to America, then we are ready to do so. And I will just mention a couple of very basic things that here in the Atlantic Council I think are quite self-evident but maybe we need to stress them again. One is the economic relation we have. 80% of foreign investment in the US comes from Europe, comes from the European Union. 80%. Not 18%, 80%. And I think we are bringing a couple of million more jobs in America with European investment. And I think you cannot find many States in the United States that are not having three hundred, four hundred thousand jobs created from Europe in America. Is this a transactional way of putting things? I do not know. But we need each other. And it is not only Europe that needs America. It is America that needs Europe and we had better recognise that to have a serious conversation. The other thing is security and even if the European Union is not NATO and we cannot make the two organisations overlap, there is a big elephant in the room that is the investment in our common security. In Europe, we have started well before the November [US Presidential] elections last summer, to work very seriously on strengthening the European defence within the European Union. And to me it was very strange because I spent from July to October, November even, reassuring Washington and the other side of Brussels, which means NATO's headquarters, that this was not to undermine NATO, not in competition with NATO but to strengthen NATO, and now I am passing these other months explaining that it is good to strengthen NATO and this is going to be the European way. I put this in the 'transactional box' because - you know that perfectly well - Article 5 was invoked only once and that was after 9/11. Europeans have carried the burden for our common commitment to security in the world through NATO but also through other means. The European Union is a security provider. It is also a hard power, even if this is not perceived too much here. We have 16 military missions and operations in the world; we are training military forces in parts of Africa where the terrorist threat is serious and present; we are operating off the coast of the Horn of Africa against piracy, that has basically disappeared from the region; we are in the Mediterranean Sea, dismantling the businesses of smugglers and traffickers of people, but also saving lives. We are also a military power, and if people are serious about the need to have European Member States investing not only more but also better on defence, this can be done with the support of the European Union. I give you an example - I think I mentioned that to you in Davos a couple of weeks ago: In Europe we invest 50% of what is invested in America for defence, but the output of our European investment on defence is 15%. Why? Because we are not working together at the economy of scale that is needed. So, here comes the added value of the European Union. We are proposing plans and funds to incentivise Member States of the European Union to work together in cooperation on developing capabilities, investing in research and innovation, strengthening their defence. This can happen with the support of the European Union. Without that, single Member States will continue to invest in a very fragmented manner and the burden sharing of our common security across the Atlantic will continue to be as it is. So, two examples of how transactional we can be. FK: So not just getting the NATO target of 2% for all the NATO Members, but actually spending the money better via the EU plans. One last question from me and then I will turn to the audience: You were talking about Europe needing the US and the US needing Europe. The impression from here – and also among many of my European friends there – is that European Union is facing potentially existential challenges. You have Brexit; you have challenges from the East; challenges from the South; centrifugal political challenges; and then the elections this year in France, Holland, Germany and so on. How do you view the state of Europe from that stand point? How serious do you think these challenges are? And even more importantly what is the US contribution, what could the U.S. contribution or the Trump administration's contribution, be at this point in this scenario? FM: For good or bad? FK: In both ways. Let’s look at a worst case scenario and a best case scenario FM: You know, I will surprise you: I think the state of our Union is strong and good. I have recently said that the European Union – Europe in general - is a little bit like a 16-year old, beautiful girl who looks at herself in the mirror and finds herself ugly and that life is awful and everything is going wrong. While we are turning 60 this year - we are going to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome at the end of March. The previous U.S. administration used to tell us very often that Europe should believe in itself as much as America believes in Europe. And I think that this sentence worth keeping very strongly in our memory, at least in Europe, because we are much more powerful, much stronger than sometimes we perceive ourselves to be. You speak about a European existential crisis. Take Brexit: eight months after the referendum, the UK has not even formally notified their willingness to start negotiations. So for sure the decision is taken but they do not seem particularly in a hurry to get out. I think this is telling a lot. And by the way, I take this chance to stress on the fact that not only is the UK still a Member State, but it will be to continue to be the case for another couple of years - minimum. So, this has to be taken into consideration because I chair three formations of the Council of the European Union – Foreign Ministers, Defence Ministers and Development Ministers -; we are still 28 around the table and we will continue to be 28 around the table. So not only do I not see others following but at the moment I still have 28 Foreign Ministers to deal with and we still take decisions by consensus. And an important thing to stress: not because we are a prison but because Member States see this as in their own interest -  as long as you are a Member State trade agreements are negotiated by the European Union. Not one single Member State, including the UK for at least for a couple of years, can negotiate bilateral trade agreements with third parties. I think this is important to state here as I understand our British friends also did also publicly - I don’t know if they did so privately - but for sure this is continuing to be the case. So in the transactional approach, there is also the trade part of the relevance of the European Union being the first market in the world - also for American goods - and the second economic power for GDP in the world. There is a bit of discussion which is one is the first but I leave it to you. FK: And the US contribution? What would you hope to be the worst case and best case? FM: I only have one case: no interference. We do not interfere in U.S. domestic politics - and there is plenty of U.S. politics these days; it is not for me to comment on that: not on political decisions, not on decisions of the court. That’s for the U.S. It is a democracy, a great democracy, strong institutions, strong people, great people. It is not for me or for any other European to comment on domestic political choices or decisions in the U.S. The same goes with Europe. No interference. By the way we do not see elections as a major challenge, elections are part of our democratic life and Europeans can take their own political decisions wisely. I have full confidence in the European democracies. And I have the impression that there is quite enough to do here [in the U.S.] and maybe free time to dedicate to European politics is not that much. Maybe ‘America first’ means also that you have to deal with America first. FK: So that seems a little bit of a minimalist approach if you think of America’s role in the post-World War II history of Europe. But you would be satisfied with that? To let Europe go forward the way it will go forward. You don't really need America’s help and assistance at this point? FM: I am saying no interference because I am hearing and seeing messages from time to time - not in my meetings here and this reassures me very, very much -, but I am hearing rumours around or seeing people, inviting Europeans to do one thing or the other, inviting Member States to do one thing or the other and I think we have to make clear that there is a certain European pride. We are grateful to America. I am Italian and I stop here. It is clear, no? It is clear. We have built our freedom, our democracies, our economies together. But we are grown up. We are turning 60 this year as a Union. We are a global power. We are responsible for ourselves. I wish we could have a friendship that continues to be a natural friendship in which we can help each other to strengthen our economies, our democracies. Democracy is always in the making. It is never perfect. That is the best case scenario. That is clear. We have never had such a strong and fruitful transatlantic partnership as we have had in these two-and-a-half years that I have been in office. That has been ideal. For me and for all us Europeans, this can continue and we would be definitely happy with that. But as I hear, sometimes, voices saying that the European Union is not necessarily a good idea, inviting to dismantle what we have managed to build and that has brought us not only peace, but also economic strength. FK: I hear you. As with the physician you start by doing no harm! FM: Yes. Then if we can do much better than this I am only happy because this is the way in which we worked in these last two years and a half. FK: Excellent. FM: For me, two years and half. Questions from the audience: Question: West Asia Council: When engaging with your American interlocutors, did you have the chance to discuss issues of migration, diversity and pluralism across the Atlantic, including refugees? FK: You did hint in your opening comments that there may be differences of opinion on migration and refugees? FM: Again, it is not for me to comment on decisions that are taken here and especially in a moment when we see that there is some institutional divergence around them. I do not comment on court decisions in my own country – imagine here. That is a good rule for any politician I believe. It is for the United States to find their own on how to manage migration. What I can say is that is that the European way – and we struggled quite a lot to find our own way, because last year, the year before, was quite painful experience - and again, being an Italian, I have been struggling for years when I was in my own country to have a common European response to a challenge that was seen in the previous years only as a national one. But finally we got, as Europeans in the European Union, to a common approach that is based on partnership and cooperation with countries of origin and transit; work to dismantle the criminal organisations; saving lives at sea and in the desert – which are the main places where people are dying on our routes; investing in local development of communities from where the flows start; protecting peoples' lives; human rights; respecting for the dignity of human beings, whoever they are, wherever they are, and whatever background they have. This is the European way. We struggled a lot to get there - yes, indeed. Is it still sometimes controversial within the European public scene? Yes, it is. But this is the common policy that we are putting in place, and this is starting to get us some results. We think that there is no way in which you can feed the illusion that migration can be stopped. Migration can be managed and has to be managed. Between the illusion of stopping the flow of people with walls and saying that everybody can come there is a reasonable, sensible and respectful manner to manage rationally and this is our way. This is the European way and this is, by the way, the way the international community agreed in New York when we decided together - all together - to establish Global Compacts for refugees and migration and we are committed to that: partnership with the IOM  [International Organization for Migration], UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] , the UN system, and especially focused on the respect of human rights of people. The history of Europe is also such that, you know, we tend to be quite sensitive when it comes to walls and the symbolism of that is strong. We tend to celebrate when walls come down and we are quite sceptical  when it comes to the idea that walls can stop people or things. They empower smugglers, normally, and they close you in an encircled area. Maybe that is because Europe has always been a continent of emigration. How many Italians do you know who have key roles here in the United States? I guess the Mayor of the city of the President [New York City] and not only the current one [Bill de Blasio], but also a few others, from [Rudolph] Giuliani to others. America has always been great because it has been made up of many people coming from different places. Europe does not have that tradition, but we know what it means to move around because you are going out of a place because of war or because you are simply looking for a better place. So again, this does not mean that by open borders - everyone can come. Not at all. But it means that there is a rational, humane way of managing this. I do not know for America but I guess, but for sure for Europe if we were to imagine that tomorrow all migrants disappear from our countries, our economies would collapse immediately. So the costs of no migration for our economies and not only but for our societies would be big. Again this does not mean that it does not have to be managed; it has to be managed in a sustainable manner, but I guess we have a different approach. I raised this, not to say ""you are wrong"" but to say ""we are doing it in a different manner"". Question: Ambassador of Azerbaijan: I know that you just met with President [of Azerbaijan Ilham] Aliyev in Brussels and it was a successful visit. When you spoke about current priorities you did not mention energy security. I wanted to ask you whether during your meetings in Washington you mentioned the southern corridor and related issues with the South Gas Corridor. And also I am very happy to hear that you said that borders should not change by force. I hope that applies to the borders of my country, the Republic of Azerbaijan. FM: The issue of energy security, which is a very relevant issue for Europe – diversification of our sources and routes are part of our security strategy, was not central in my talks here. This does not mean that it will not be and I had an excellent opportunity on Monday meeting with your President to restate our strong support to the Southern Gas Corridor and that will continue to be the case. By the way, I think that you are hosting in the coming week the meeting where last year I was present together with my interlocutor here in the United States, to show our common support to the project. On the European side this is going to continue. Question: Voice of America, Albanian Service: On the judiciary reform in Albania: the EU and the United States have been investing really heavily in having this reform approved in the country but already there have been concerns expressed by both representatives about issues with implementing the reform or sort of some efforts to deter the reform. Are you concerned about this and how do you see the future of implementation? And, if possible, you talked about the plate full of opportunities between the U.S. and the EU to work together on international issues. With the U.S. adopting a stand of ‘America, first’ and this full plate, will the Balkans get the short thrift? You know how important the transatlantic cooperation has been for the region. Thank you, grazie. FM: First on the judiciary reform in Albania: I had the honour to address the Albanian parliament just on the eve of the unanimous vote on the judicial reform and I think that was really an historic step for the country. Obviously for us what is important is that now the same unity and the same determination is shown on the implementation of the reform, and I am confident that the country can find this strength in the institutions to do that, because I know how much Albanians attach importance to this reform and I think – not only I, we think - that this is also key to move forward on the European Union integration path for the country, which is an open path. You know that there is an open door and I really hope that this will manage to be built in a sense of national unity. I know that this is not the favourite sport in Albania but I think when it comes to the interest of the citizens this is a must. On the Western Balkans: this was part of many of my conversations here in Washington to pass the message, indeed, that for us in the European Union the work with the Western Balkans is key, is a priority, also because sometimes we refer to this region as on its way to Europe, we do not realise that it is Europe, it is the heart of Europe. And for us in the European Union the regional cooperation and the fact that every single country moves towards its reform path and, finally, integration in the European Union, is essential. And the message that I passed here was for that to happen we need to continuous engagement from the region – and I see that engagement, with all the difficulties, I see that engagement -; continuous strong focus from the European Union's side – and you can count on me personally and on the leadership in the European Union to make sure that this happens and continues to happen; and also on a clear vision in Washington to continue to be focused in the Western Balkans in a constructive manner, and I hope that the message was heard. Question: Latino Victory Project: When [German] Chancellor, Angela Merkel congratulated President [Donald] Trump, she offered cooperation on the basis of values – democracy, rule of law, etc. Now, hearing your comments here today, I hear a more - as you put it - a more transactional approach. Is it fair to say that there is a difference in degree or what would be the balance between values/transactional approach? Question: Arms Control Association: Thank you for your leadership on the JCPOA. It was reassuring to hear you say that that there is a commitment to the implementation of the agreement [JPCOA] but as we approach some key deadlines, sanctions waiver dates, are you concerned that Congress may initiate actions that Iran might interpret to be violations of the JPCOA – in other words, sanctions that might have the same effect as some of the old nuclear-related sanctions. Are you confident that the deal will be able to navigate through this period of the next two or three months? FM: The most frequent question I get is if I am concerned about something. There are plenty of reasons to be concerned. We are not living easy times nor in an easy world. What I can tell you is that the European Union – which means all Europeans and me personally with my special role on the JPCOA implementation –, we will monitor carefully and in a very strict manner the implementation of the deal in its entirety, from all sides. And that it is a clear European interest – a shared interest - to preserve the agreement and its implementation. I don’t know if, again, confidence and optimism is category of foreign policy – I tend to believe not – but I can tell you the determination we have to make sure that the deal is preserved and fully implemented and strictly implemented by all, in all parts. On the previous question: I can tell you one thing that is one hundred percent clear. There is no distinction, not even different shadows in the European attitude towards the United States. And I know that - not because I read it somewhere – but because exactly one week ago, last Friday, I was in Malta for the summit with all Heads of State and Government of the European Union, including Theresa May [Prime Minister of the United Kingdom] who was just back from Washington and she shared with us her assessment of her visit, and we had a conversation not only Chancellor [Angela] Merkel, President [of the French Republic, François] Hollande, all of the 28 on our approach to the transatlantic partnership and the U.S.. What I described as ""transactional"" – I don't like the word too much, but I guess that was used for the first time here - I would talk about a pragmatic approach that is based on values, our values, that we assume are common values, but again we are in a moment when we can state things for ourselves, so European values and European interests, with a sense of friendship but also with a clear sense of priorities when it comes to making clear that some European values and interests are not under discussion. So, it is friendship, it doesn't change, otherwise I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be looking forward to welcoming Vice-President [Mike] Pence ten days from now in Brussels for his official visit to the EU institutions. Friendship, cooperation, on the basis of our values, on the basis of our interests, but also with clear ideas on what cannot be in doubt when it comes some of our priorities. FK: Thank you, High Representative. We know that you have to go now to another meeting. Let me just say a couple of things in closing. First of all, this is an important time for you to be in the United States. We hope you’ll come frequently. FM: I will come next month. FK: Great. Anytime you are where, whenever the Atlantic Council can be of assistance we would love to do it. Your voice is an important one and in my lifetime I am not sure that the transatlantic relationship has played as important role for the future – or a more important role - as it does now. So on behalf of the audience and everybody listening to us online and elsewhere, thank you so much for taking the time, thank you so much for this timely trip to the United States. FM: Thank you. Washington"
Remarks by High Representative Mogherini at the press roundtable during the visit to the United States of America,10.02.2017,10.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20408_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press roundtable during the visit to the United States of America Washington, 9 February 2017 Check against delivery!  I just say a few words to frame my visit here. We thought – not only me personally, but obviously this is something I discussed with all the 28 Member States and the rest of my colleagues in the European institutions – it was good for me to come early after the new administration came in to start opening channels for cooperation with the new administration. So I am glad that a couple of weeks after the inauguration I could come and have meetings yesterday with Secretary of State, [Rex] Tillerson, with the [National Security Adviser] General [Michael] Flynn, with [Senior Adviser Jared] Kushner and with several senators, in particular with Senator [Bob] Corker, Senator [John] McCain and many others – I think 6 or 7 in total. I also have today a public event at the Atlantic Council on transatlantic relations and some media to first of all pass the message that friendship across the Atlantic between Europeans and Americans is strong, goes beyond any change in the administration be it in Europe or here and that this continues to be the sense Europeans have. Second, that we believe that even if we are entering a time of a more pragmatic and transactional kind of relationship with the United States, there are many fields on which we coincide and where it is vital for the US to work together with the European Union and for the European Union to work with the US, be it in counter-terrorism, be it economic growth, job creation. Our economic ties are incredibly relevant. We are the first market for the United States, we are the second economy in the world and the relevance, the impact of the European Union cannot be underestimated even if I know that sometimes this is put at question here and in the European Union. And this is the other issue and I would like to underline that it was part of my conversations, the strength of the European Union and the unity of the European Union - I believe it is more evident today that it was some months ago and this has to be clearly understood here and this also means respect for the European Union which is not simply an institution; it is a Union of 28 Member States. Still 28 and 28 for quite some months ahead of us; 8 months after the referendum in the UK we have not even been notified about the beginning of negotiations, so UK will stay a Member State of the European Union for another two years at least. This also implies that it will not be able to negotiate any trade agreement bilaterally with any third country which is the case of all the Member States, not because we limit our Member States but because this is the guarantee for all Europeans that we are stronger in trade negotiations, being the second economy in the world, and because this guarantee is that the benefit of any trade agreement goes equally to all Europeans without any internal competition so it is a form of guarantee for all Europeans and it is not a limitation. So, Europeans have an interest in keeping and even making the strength of the European Union stronger or more evident and this has to be clearly understood and respected here, as we respect fully the internal dynamics of the United States in which I would not enter but it seems interesting to observe from the outside at this moment.  Q. What kind of reception did you get at the your meetings with Tillerson at the State Department, how do they deal with the EU and did you get any sense of whether the United States really has formed an unified policy and expression of administration? I received an excellent reception. And  I was received quite early in the beginning of the work with the administration. Tillerson just started one week ago so that is really early and gives me a sense of priority that is put in working with the European Union as such and I had excellent meetings both with the Tillerson in the White House and in the Senate. Again not only on the need to cooperate, but also on some issues we started to discuss: be it Syria, be it counter-terrorism, be it Russia and Ukraine, Libya, the Middle East Peace Process and many other files. We had excellent conversations and we decided to follow this up. Actually we have a quite intense round of meetings coming up because [James] Mattis [US Secretary of Defence] will be in Brussels for the NATO Defence Ministers meeting on Wednesday. I always join the Defence Ministers’ Meeting – and it will be the case also this time – so I will meet him there; then we will be together at the G20 in Bonn with Tillerson. We will be together with Vice-President [Mike] Pence and a large US delegation at the [Munich] Security Conference. We are very happy to welcome Vice-President Pence on his official visit to Brussels to the EU institutions on 20 February. So you see that the intensity of the calendar of exchanges and meetings is quite unique, exceptional and this also gives a sense of where priorities are put. So I see that there is an intention to work closely together and the same on our side. When it comes to how much policies are determined I think as with any transition this might need some time - to review some policies, to have people in places. Changes in the administration normally take some time and I understand that compared to previous American transitions this is taking a little bit more, but again this is not for me to comment. And, by the way, this is also a good opportunity for us to have early conversations on some policy orientations because I believe that it is not irrelevant for our American friends to know where the Europeans are on some issues.  Q. You mentioned Russia, Ukraine. Did you get any sort of assurances or were you looking for any sort of assurances that the US is committed to sanctions and that the Minsk agreement is implemented? There has been speculation that Ted Malloch is going to be the Ambassador of the US to the EU. Did you also raise specific concerns with the administration? On the first issue: yes. We agreed on the need to have a full implementation of the Minsk agreements and on the fact that sanctions are linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. We discussed at length the ways in which we can support more the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. This is exactly the European approach also to this issue. For us, sanctions, are not a policy in itself, are a tool. The objective is to have the full implementation of the Minsk agreements and the conflict in the east of Ukraine solved and if we can work together to this goal that would be obviously good. So, yes, on this we share the same views.  Q. When you say ‘we’, are you talking about the discussions with the Secretary of State? With [Secretary of State, Rex] Tillerson, yes.  Q. What about Flynn? No, I am not going to give details, but I had conversations with all my interlocutors going in the same direction.  Q. And the message on Russia was consistent? Yes. As I said, I did not see particular divergences. I received quite – not only reassuring but also coherent messages on the issues we discussed; some of the issues we discussed. On the second point, I was told there was no decision taken on the next US Ambassador to the European Union. I made clear that, first of all, our procedures require the active consent of all the 28 Member States of the European Union for the accreditation of an ambassador and that has to be taken into consideration; that is our intention to have a smooth start and that as it is the case for any ambassador anywhere in the world, the basis is respect.  Q. It sounds like from what you are saying that the message is that he might not be the best… I was told there is no decision taken and that there is no specific name considered at this moment.  Q. So how do you see the administration’s image of the European Union changed? Do you see that there has been as a significant change compared to the previous administration stand, did people as part of the solution ask more to Europeans to contribute on security? The message I received here is of a high relevance of the European Union as such and I would build my considerations and policies and suggest to my European colleagues to do the same on what I heard on my official meetings here. Previous administrations - well I have seen only one - gave a very strong and powerful message - actually even the fact that Europeans had to believe more in the European Union. I would always remember that both the message of President Obama gave in Germany last summer and that Secretary Kerry gave in Brussels during the same period of time was exactly this sentence and I quote – and I quote it quite often to my fellow Europeans: “Europeans should believe in the European Union as much as we do”, which is a good message to hear and it is a message we hear from many of our partners in the world. They see the European Union is quite a miracle if you consider the centuries of war that we have behind us. Here I know very well – and I'm not going to be politically correct, it is not the time of history for that – that there are some that believe that any process of be it regional integration, be it multilateralism, be it an approach that brings together – you can call it souvereignism, or nationalism – this is not on their political agenda. But this is not the European choice. A new era in our relationship can mean that we can enter into a more pragmatic and transnational time; this can also mean that we differ in our political views from time to time and that we would be very clear on this. Europeans - and you will hear this from Poland to Portugal, from Finland to Malta –, Europeans feel and believe that their interests are better protected and promoted through our Union because we are more relevant and that in the world of today that being together as a Union is the only way we have to regain our sovereignty. This is not the choice that the majority of the UK population has expressed, but for the rest of the Europeans - and also for parts of the UK citizens who voted differently in the referendum that is the case -,  so the European Union is here to stay, is here, I believe, to grow even stronger and sure there is this political debate also in some of the European countries, but elections will determine whether this will be a majority approach or not.  Q. Is there a concern now that there is some talk within the circles of administration that some are trying to tilt these European elections away from a pro-European Union path. I understand you do not want be political, but… You know, we do not interfere in US politics. You might see this happening from other parts of the world; you will never see this happening from Europe. And Europeans expect that America does not interfere in European politics. Is that political enough? And I would add to be even more political: Europeans are wise enough to make their political choices for themselves. This has always been the case in history. This continues to be the case. No one tells us what to choose.  Q. Did you feel that you needed to communicate that? No.  Q. Did you discuss the Middle East Peace Process with [Senior Adviser] Jared Kushner? Did they reaffirm any commitment to the two-States solution and did you talk about the embassy? Yes, we discussed about this, not only with him, but also with my other interlocutors. I raised two issues. One is the clear restatement of the European Union positions that are the positions we shared with the United States, Russia and the United Nations within the Quartet just a few months ago. We worked together on a very intense report with very clear recommendations on how to reach the two-State solution - which is the basis for us, continues to be the basis for us to engage directly with Israelis and Palestinians and we have very frequent exchanges both with Palestine and with Israel and we discussed about this; and the possibility, for us, to continue to work together not only the US and European Union on the two-State solution and the ways to get there, but also within the Quartet. Second point I raised: yes, the issue of the possibility to move the Embassy of the United States to Jerusalem. I raised, first of all, the position of the European Union: we are not moving our Embassies anywhere, they stay where they are, not only the European Union embassy but also the others of European Member States because that is for us based on a UN Security Council Resolution. And I also raised the concerns I have had already the chance to express in public that such a move might inflame the Arab public opinions in a way that would not be productive and useful for Israel, first of all, and for the stability in the Middle East.  Q. What kind of perceptions did that get? I am not going to share that. It is a good rule to share what I raised, but not what my interlocutors did.  Q. Do you think you have more work to do on these issues to advance your view a bit with this administration? I think we have a space for common work on this. As I said, I know that there is sometimes the perception here that Americans are on the side of Israelis and Europeans are on the side of Palestinians. Our perception in Europe is that we are on the same side, being it of both. On the basis of our work with the parties for the two-State solution. This is what I often discuss with Prime Minister [of Israel, Benyamin] Netanyahu and President [of Palestine, Mahmoud] Abbas. Europeans are friends of both, Israel and Palestine and we work as an honest broker to try and build the space for them to come together. We believe in direct negotiations, not on an imposition of a solution. But we believe that the international community has a responsibility to create the framework and the space for the parties to come and meet and find their own way to get the two States - and on this I always agreed both with President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Q. Is there a policy within the Trump administration regarding two-State solution. Did you express any concern? I stated very clearly what the European Union's position and what the Quartet's position is and we share it.  Q. A follow-up on the Minsk Protocol: did you express a commitment by the Europeans to keep sanctions on Russia and that you saw that it was important to stay there until Russia makes a move on Ukraine? What was your discussion on Iran: there is a talk here that they could rip it up, and you have seen the rhetoric the actions against Iran lately. Does that concern you? On Minsk, I think I stated this very clearly. We agreed that the full implementation of the Minsk agreements is a must and that sanctions are linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. And that we would be not only happy but actively supporting a full implementation of the Minsk agreements and the lifting of the sanctions if this happens, which you can also see the other way round: not happening until the Minsk agreements are implemented fully. On Iran, this was extremely important for me. This was one of the objectives of my visit because, as you know, in this respect on the nuclear deal I do not only have the responsibility to represent the European position, but also I am still chairing the Joint Commission overviewing the implementation of the nuclear agreement, so I also have a responsibility towards Russia, China and the UN system as this has been endorsed by a UN Security Council Resolution. I always made clear from the very beginning: this is not a bilateral agreement, this is not even an agreement between Iran and some countries; this is belonging now to the international community as a whole. So for me, it was extremely important to stress the need to stick to the full implementation of the nuclear deal, as we see is happening now since one year. Four times the IAEA has certified the full implementation of the Iranians' nuclear commitments. So the deal is working and we need to preserve it this way and I was reassured by what I heard in my meetings of the intention to stick to the full and strict implementation of the agreement in its parts. This I think is a very important statement, and I would expect obviously that this would be consistently followed up.  Q. There are some that are reading the latest actions by the Trump administration as aimed at pushing Iran to leave the deal. Did you get assurances on this? There are three separate issues here, and I would like to be very clear on that. First, common understanding and, for us, a must that the nuclear agreement is fully implemented in all its parts and by all sides. Second, there are issues that are outside the nuclear deal, that are related to missile tests, that are related to terrorist activities, that are related to human rights where the European Union has restrictions and sanctions in place, and we also discussed that. The third element is that the European Union and its Member States, continue and will continue, as the nuclear deal is implemented, to have open channels with Iran. We have several issues where we have started cooperation. I myself have visited Tehran several times with different colleagues. We have started fruitful cooperation and we will continue to do that, be it economic cooperation, be it scientific cooperation, be it dialogue on human rights, be it common work we do on migration, on energy. You name it. This European engagement with Iran will continue. Then there are things that are difficult to discuss with Iran even for us. That is clear. I mentioned human rights issues, I mentioned some of the regional crises where for sure we don't see in the same manner, but we believe in engagement and the European way to diplomacy is to talk and to try to work together even when you don't agree, and this will continue.  Q. Did you discourage the Trump administration from exerting additional pressure on their 'number two issues' for fear of the Iranians losing trust in the nuclear agreement? No. As I said, in the European Union we do have sanctions still in place for non-nuclear-related issues. So we are doing that. It would be very strange for me to discourage that. In the European Union we are not introducing additional sanctions.  Q. Question inaudible It's not something new the fact that European policy towards Iran is different to the US one. We have political and economic relations with Iran; that was not the case also with the previous US administration. We have different policies – the Europeans have different relations with Iran. And for us it's a priority to continue investing in Iran's engagement with us, with the international community – again, on issues where we can work together, on issues where it's more difficult. But the Europeans will continue to follow this engagement policy. That has to be very clear.  Q. Did you discuss the Russian cyber threat at all and the fear that they could impact European elections in the coming months? That was not a major point of our discussion.  Q. Did you talk about the TTIP or about the plans to build a wall with Mexico? Could you tie together what you've said? You said this could become a more transactional and pragmatic relationship. After 8 years of the Obama administration, working together on everything. There is clearly a new direction in the US leadership. Does this mean that the EU will work for common objectives but will go its own way if agree with this administration? It is not our responsibility to determine the sense of direction of US policy, now or in the future. And it was not even in the past. We want to work together on as many as possible of the common issues that we have on the table – and we have many – the world is getting quite complicated, to put it mildly. But we do it on the basis of our values and our interests. European values and interests are very well determined and very clear to us. And on the basis of that we start a conversation and see where we can work together, when we have different opinions. When we have different opinions and still we have converging interests, we have to be clear which are our positions. It is not for us to determine positions here [in the US]. It is for us to make clear what our priorities, our expectations are and to stick to that. Protect the interest of European citizens. When it comes to free trade, I see and I understand that this new administration is not yet clear on where they want to go on TTIP. We stand as a strong point of reference and a reliable interlocutor for all of our partners in the world on free and fair trade and on an open global system of trade. We are going to finalise our trade agreement with Canada next week. And the European Union will continue to be a reliable point of reference for everybody in the world on free and fair trade. The same goes on migration where for sure we have a different approach. Again, it is not for me to determine US policies or to comment on US policies; domestic choices. I see that there is enough American debate for me to add a European voice. I leave it to the US political debate. But we make clear what we believe is the right way, which is the way that we are following, which is based on cooperation, partnership, protection of human rights, saving lives at sea and in the desert, for what comes to the European challenge to manage the migration routes, and a global work in the UN system. Just a few months ago in New York we launched, together with a big coalition of countries in the UN framework, a global compact for managing migration and refugees. We believe in the role of the UN system – UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration, and a rational, sustainable, human, sensible way of managing the flows. Which doesn't mean that our doors are open to everybody, but it also doesn't mean that we build walls or we discriminate on the basis of nationality. So, this is the European way. This transactional approach or this pragmatic approach means that we make clear what our position is. Q. It used to be that the US provided a lot of leadership and now it seems that the Europeans are going to have to pick up a lot of that slack on leading these issues. We are ready.

Federica Mogherini meets Rex Tillerson and US representatives to discuss EU-US relations,09.02.2017,09.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20319_en,,"Federica Mogherini meets Rex Tillerson and US representatives to discuss EU-US relations Federica Mogherini, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission, is today and tomorrow in Washington for her first visit after the inauguration of the new US administration. High Representative Mogherini had a fruitful meeting with the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to discuss the mutual interest of bringing forward the longstanding cooperation between the European Union and the United States on the main international files. They spoke at length, among other topics, about Trans-Atlantic relations, the common challenge of countering terrorism, the ongoing work to strengthen European Defence, relations with Russia, the Iran nuclear deal and the main crises, from Ukraine to Syria. They agreed to continue working together and meet again soon. Federica Mogherini has invited Secretary Tillerson to address the EU Foreign Affairs Council at his earliest convenience. ""I was pleased to meet Secretary Tillerson. We had an open exchange on many dossiers that we are dealing with. The European Union and the United States have a longstanding relationship and we will work to bring it forward on the basis of our principles and our interests. There are many files on which the EU and the US have an interest to closely cooperate,"" Mogherini said. During her first day of visit, the High Representative met with members of Congress, among which Ron Johnson, Bob Corker, John McCain, Jack Reed, Chris Murphy and Jeanne Shaheen, to discuss EU-US bilateral relations and the main international dossiers. Later in the day, Mogherini will meet at the White House with National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, and with Senior Adviser Jared Kushner. Bruxelles"
Statement by the Spokesperson on the verdict in the trial of Alexei Navalny,08.02.2017,08.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20225_en,,"The verdict of the Leninsky Court in Kirov today against Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny on charges of embezzlement attempts to silence yet another independent political voice in the Russian Federation. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that Mr Navalny had been denied the right to a fair trial in his prosecution in 2013 for the same charges. This latest decision, which effectively excludes Mr Navalny from the political arena, further constrains political pluralism in Russia and raises serious questions as to the fairness of democratic processes in Russia.

EU Statement on Domestic Violence in the Russian Federation at the OSCE Permanent Council,07.02.2017,07.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20039_en,,"At the OSCE Permanent Council No 1132 in Vienna on 2 February 2017 the EU made a Statement on Domestic Violence in the Russian Federation. The European Union and its Member States share the concern expressed by our distinguished colleague from the US. We have many commitments, going back many years, on combating domestic violence in all its forms. Indeed, it was in Moscow, in 1991 that participating States agreed to “seek to eliminate all forms of violence against women”. We recall the conference on Violence Against Women – Bringing Security Home which took place in Hofburg on 22 July 2016, and the joint OSCE-UN Symposium on combating Femicide, which also took place here in November, where participants stressed the need and identified ways to combat violence against women in all its forms. We also recall our statement on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in December last year We believe we must speak out now about proposed legislation in Russia that would decriminalise domestic violence: reducing ‘battery within the family’ from a criminal to an administrative offence, with weaker sanctions for offenders. We note that this legislation has not yet been signed into law. We are raising this issue now given the seriousness of the matter and in the sincere hope that those responsible might consider the full implications of this action. No country is immune from domestic violence which claims so many victims each year all across the OSCE region. It is true within the Member States of the European Union as it is elsewhere. We therefore call on the Russian Delegation to relay our concerns that this legislation, if adopted, would be a retrograde step, which would send the wrong message about the Russian authorities’ commitment to tackling violence against women and children.  The Candidate Countries the FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA*, MONTENEGRO* and ALBANIA*, the Country of the Stabilisation and Association Process and Potential Candidate BOSNIA and HERZEGOVINA, and the EFTA countries ICELAND, LIECHTENSTEIN and NORWAY, members of the European Economic Area, as well as UKRAINE, align themselves with this statement. * The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.

Remarks by the HRVP Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,06.02.2017,06.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/20031_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council Check against delivery! As you know, we had a very long day today and intense Foreign Affairs Council where we had four main points on our agenda. First of all, the situation in Ukraine where we restated, with all the Ministers, the strong support of the European Union to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements; our willingness to accompany and support even more the work of our colleagues in the Normandy format and the work of the OSCE, especially on the ground - we discussed this also with the Austrian Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE. And, at the same time, we focused our discussion on the European Union's support to the reform agenda of the country, in particular the efforts that the Prime Minister [Volodymyr Groysman], the President [Petro Poroshenko] and the government are putting into reforming the country when it comes to the social and economic measures and anti-corruption, which for us is key. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine with a special focus on the delivery of services to the population and trying to make sure that the conditions in the country improve for the people. And, obviously, this requires also a better security situation, and the situation in the east in the last days was definitively extremely worrying for us. So when we refer to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, we obviously restate our expectation that the fighting stops there and that a process of peace can be started effectively. The second point we had on the agenda today was the situation in Libya. I would start by saying that the focus that we had today was mainly on the political, the security and the economic situation in the country. We obviously also followed-up on the Malta Summit, where I was last Friday presenting to the Heads of State or Government some proposals on our work to manage the migration through the Central Mediterranean route. But today the message that comes out of the Foreign Affairs Council is that our work with Libya, for Libyans and with Libyans mainly is going much beyond the issue of migration and the main focus is our political work. First of all, to guarantee inclusiveness, to support the Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Libyan Political Agreement; the delivery of services to the Libyans starting with health and social measures. We have, as you know, a package of concrete support that the European Union is putting in place in partnership not only with the Government of National Accord but also with the municipalities and we are continuing in this respect all over the territory of Libya – West, East and South. And for us this is going to be very important. This is something that we decided clearly with the Ministers today - I think you will have or you have already the Council conclusions we adopted today. We decided today to engage much more not only with the Libyan interlocutors on the ground, but also with the regional actors, supporting the Tunisian efforts to bring together the regional actors and the neighbours, namely Egypt and Algeria. But we also decided today to respond positively to the invitation that we have received, the European Union has received, to join the African Union, the League of Arab States and the United Nations, transforming in this way the Troika into a Quartet to try to accompany a process that has to see the political transition in Libya coming to a positive moment and this requires a full positive Libyan ownership. As I said, and you will find it in the Council conclusions that you will have the opportunity to read, there is a strong support to the Government of National Accord and the Libyan Political Agreement but there is also readiness to accompany changes if the Libyans see the need for that and how, it will be up to them to define. I had already the chance to state in the recent days that it is not for the Europeans or for the international community to decide on the government, or the governance, on the people that will run the country. What we can clearly say is that we recognise the international legitimacy as backed in the UN Security Council resolutions and obviously we see that there is no way in which a military solution can rule and unite a country after so much suffering. So the European Union is at the disposal of the Libyans to accompany them on the way they choose to try and improve the living conditions of the county, to restore security and make sure that Libya – which is a rich country that does not need naturally economical or financial support - can benefit from its own resources, going directly to the Libyan people. As a follow-up to the Malta Declaration, obviously the Ministers focused also on the work we will do on the external side of our work on migration in the Central Mediterranean route, aspects related to our work with Libya, and I would like to mention here only three points that I stressed also in Malta and on which Ministers today agreed very much. One is to continue our work with the Southern neighbours of Libya to control better the Libyan Southern border and namely to facilitate meetings between Libya, Niger and Chad. I am convinced that the African Union can play a significant role, also seeing who has become the new President of the African Union Commission, former Foreign Minister of Chad [Moussa Faki Mahamat], this work will for sure benefit from his presence in Addis Ababa. Second, the work inside Libya and here we agreed with the Ministers to increase our work and our partnership with the IOM and the UNHCR, including financing. The European Union is already financing a project of the IOM to assist migrants in the camps. Living conditions in the camps are awful and our main concern is to try and facilitate the work of the UN agencies, IOM and UNHCR to support the stranded migrants and assist them along the route and at sea, we decided to strengthen the work we are doing with Operation Sophia, training the Libyan coastguards and navy, including training on human rights and women's rights, because we see that people who are dying now are not anymore in international waters but in Libyan waters. This is a Libyan responsibility, not a European responsibility, but we can help in saving lives and trying to make this not happen again. In this respect, I am proud that on Wednesday, the day after tomorrow, I will be able to be on the flagship of Operation Sophia, off the coast of Malta to hand over together with the Maltese presidency, with the Maltese Prime Minister, the diplomas to the first group of Libyan coastguards, trained with Operation Sophia. The second group of trainees has started already the training, so we are now at the second slot of training and I think this will enable the Libyans and the Libyan authorities, to control the sovereignty of their country, including their territorial waters, in a more effective manner. All of this, and in particular of the European Union's support to Libya, both from a social, economic, security and political perspective, I have discussed this last week with Prime Minister of [Libya Fayez Al] Sarraj and with the UN Special Envoy Martin Kobler, whom I would like to thank for the incredible work he is doing and obviously we will continue to work together with them. The third point we had on our agenda today was our relations with Egypt, where we agreed with the Ministers on increasing our engagement with the country that is a key regional player, with whom we will work along four lines. One is to help Egypt face the economic and social challenges. It is a country of 94 million people, half of which are below the age of 25, with a youth unemployment rate around 30%. It is our clear interest to support the economic reforms but also the growth and the jobs creation in the country. So economic cooperation, including measures to protect the most vulnerable, which means social measures and measures to achieve an inclusive economic growth, are and will continue to be at the centre of our cooperation with Egypt. So, first the economic cooperation. Second, the work on the political track; democracy, human rights, rule of law, the work for an open society are all at the centre of our exchanges with the Egyptian authorities. This will continue to be the case as we increase cooperation with the country and you know that this is particularly important for the European Union. Third element, we decided to increase our cooperation with Egypt on some sectorial files that are particularly important for both of us. I just mentioned two examples but we could have many others. One is cooperation on counterterrorism that is starting and we want to intensify and the second is work on migration where we have in principle an agreement to set up a formal migration dialogue between the European Union and Egypt. Finally, but for me this is the most important point of all maybe, it is to increase our work which is already ongoing on the regional issues. I just spoke about Libya, I will say in a minute a few words about the Middle East Peace Process. Egypt is a key country when it comes to different regional dynamics, it is a key country when it comes to the Arab world, and it is a country with whom we want to work also to try and find solutions being it for an inclusive and effective government in Libya, being it for two States in Israel and Palestine. This is also why we decided to invite Minister [of Foreign Affairs of Egypt Sameh] Shoukry at the next Foreign Affairs Council and I am quite optimistic on the fact that he can accept our invitation, hopefully the date will be convenient but I guess so. Last but not least, we had a point on the Middle East Peace Process. As you noticed this issue is very often on our agenda, almost every month. I think this is in itself a relevant thing to do, in a time when we see quite some changes in the consolidated policies of the international community. What does not change is the EU position on the two States, on the settlements, on Jerusalem, and it is useful for the European Union to restate its willingness to work with the international community, within the Quartet, with our friends in the United States, in the UN and in Moscow, with our Arab friends and interlocutors, starting from Egypt but also with Jordan, or the League of Arab States, or Saudi Arabia, to find the way to get to the two States. I know that this is not the message you will hear most often around the world now but you will continue to hear that consistently from Europe. And this is something that unites all Europeans. I will discuss this, among other things, with our interlocutors in Washington later this week, but also here in Europe the following week for some visits we are expecting also in Brussels. As you might know, Vice-President [of the United States Mike] Pence is coming to pay a visit to the European Union's institutions on the 20th if I am not wrong. But before that I will travel to Washington later this week and we will have at the margins of the G20 in Bonn and also at the Munich Security Conference and at the NATO defence ministerial other rounds of meetings so we will have in the next twenty days intense exchanges with our counterparts of the US administration on the Middle East and also on other issues including those that we discussed today with the Foreign Ministers. On the Middle East Peace Process I can also share with you that we decided not only to engage with the United States in this new era, seeing where we have common ground to work together through the Quartet, but also that we decided to start the preparations for an Association Council with Israel, so that work will start. That is going to be a good opportunity, a good tool, to exchange views and hopefully also find common grounds with one of the two parties. We constantly keep our engagement with the two sides, very intense, at all different levels, from Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ministers and including civil society, that will continue. I will stop here. I hope I did not forget anything; otherwise I count on your questions. Thank you. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I132970  Q. What exactly would be discussed at a EU-Israel Association Council meeting? Are you concerned at the intensification of the settlements policy that we have seen in the very recent times? I think that the European Union released the clearest statement when it comes to the expansion of settlements or rather the announcement last 1 February to build further settlement units.  You will always hear very clear words from the European Union on this. This is based on our legal assessment: we consider settlements illegal from an international point of view and we consider that they do not help at all, on the contrary they make it more difficult to achieve a two-State solution that is the outcome that the Israeli government still refers to as the end game of negotiations. So we believe that no unilateral step should be taken that could endanger the results of a direct negotiation aiming at a two-State solution. This is a very clear position that the European Union has, continues to have and will continue to have. When it comes to the Association Council, we decided today to start preparing the Association Council so the exact content and scope of this will be discussed now and decided at 28 by unanimity. And normally what I can share with you is that the Association Council is the institutional moment  when the two parties, the European Union with Member States, all of them, on one side and the partner, exchange on first of all bilateral issues. We have a lot of files on which we work bilaterally with Israel, including some issues that are relevant to the Israeli society and also to the European society. And also some of the regional and foreign policy issues and for sure this will be also part of our discussions. I would like to stress the fact that the Association Council is, yes, the formal moment when this takes place and preparations start now, but contacts and exchanges and work continue to be constant both with Palestinian and the Israeli side. I had meetings with relevant ministers, I think exactly two weeks ago in Barcelona at the margins of the Union for the Mediterranean, and constant telephone contacts and meetings so this will continue. It is a regular work that we will carry on with both parties. Q. Very often we have been told that the European Union is dealing with the relevant authorities on the ground in Libya and the western part of Libya - Haftar – is controlling wide area liberated from Da’esh and other terrorist groups. Why the European Union is not even mentioning on the communiqué of today and allow me a second question that European Union does not like walls, of course, but when it comes to the African migrants, the European Union is building for them – or encouraging for them - camps in a very unsafe country as Mr Sigmar Gabriel [Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Germany] said this morning. I would like to thank you, especially for this second question. On the first one, I have no problem in answering it very quickly. I can mention [Khalifa] Haftar obviously but when you see in the communiqué and you hear in my words, our support to the regional and international efforts, including the one that Tunisia is bringing forward, is exactly to facilitate a dialogue between Prime Minister [Fayez] al-Sarraj and General [Khalifa] Haftar. This is a work we support; we see the need for all players in Libya to try and find their common ground to unite the country. We recognise the Government of National Accord as we recognise the legitimacy that comes from the UN Security Council resolutions. This is the basis of our international work always. But we encourage dialogue; we encourage engagement and we encourage coming together and here again the European Union is not there to dictate, or impose or indicate even solutions that are only up to the Libyans to define. But we will always be at the side of the Libyans and of the regional players to accompany any efforts to unite the country and to unite the players that can unite the country. When it comes to migration, I thank you very much for the question, because it provides me with the opportunity to clarify very clearly – sorry for using the term twice - of what we are doing and the intentions and also the results that we are looking for in our work. We have a situation in this moment; when we managed to save 32 000 people only last year in the international waters off the coast of Libya and this is together with the dismantling of the traffickers’ networks, our primary objective: saving lives, protecting lives and dismantling the traffickers’ networks. It is mostly in Libyan territorial waters that last year alone 4500 people died. Libyan territorial waters are not where the Operation Sophia, or the European Union, or an international presence can operate. This is a responsibility of the Libyans, otherwise it would be violation of sovereignty and we know how much it is important and relevant that sovereignty is exercised by the Libyans themselves. This is why we are working so much in helping the Libyan Coast Guards and Navy and we hope that we manage to be even more outreaching in terms of scope that we manage to cover, but again we already have the second group that has started the training, in order to allow them to take control of their territorial waters and of their coast, in order to do exactly the same things we do in the international waters. First, to save lives and second, to dismantle the traffickers’ networks. This at sea, but we are also doing, as you know very well because I have repeated it several times here, work South of Libya with the IOM. We are financing the presence in Agadez to support, assist and advise and in some cases save stranded migrants that cross the desert before they get to Libya, because we know very well that the security situation and the human rights situation in Libya is awful and so we try to assist the migrants before they get to the Libyan border and you know that the results, if I am not wrong, are of registering a drop from 76 000 roughly of migrants passing through  Agadez in last May to 11 000 last November or December. This means that assistance in the desert is starting to pay off. But then we cannot ignore - and exactly because we care about human rights - ignore the fact that there are migrants inside Libya already. We are not bringing migrants into Libya; on the contrary we are trying to prevent smugglers to bring migrants into Libya or to exploit their desperation. But we cannot close our eyes in front of the fact that there are migrants at this moment trapped in these detention camps in Libya. How do we want to face this situation? How does the international community want to react to that? Do we have the courage to face this? And what is the answer to that? Now, the European Union has identified one way to manage this situation and save the people who are now in the camps; now, today as we speak, women, children. I heard those stories. The only way is to let the IOM, the UNHCR into the camps. This requires the cooperation of the Libyan authorities, the government, the municipalities, hopefully others, the cooperation of the Libyans, it needs some security, which is probably one of the most difficult things to fix and needs financial support. We are trying to work on all these three things and more than anything else we are working together with the IOM and the UNHCR and the Libyans to try to solve or at least to tackle the dramatic humanitarian condition of the migrants inside Libya. If you don’t do it, what will be their destiny? It will not disappear simply because you refuse to look at it. So, sure, it is a difficult situation, we are taking responsibility for something that is happening not in our territory, but we cannot see these people either dying or living this way without doing anything. This is the work we are doing and we are going to do: trying to bring the UN agencies to do the work that they can do with the proper human rights standards, with the proper international standards in camps that today have no, or almost no, international access or international control. It is going to be a big effort. To me it is a little bit of a paradox that while we try to improve the living conditions, to save lives and to solve a problem that again is not happening in the European Union waters or international waters, or European territory – that you have to ask to another Commissioner - but it is something happening in another sovereign country. We are trying to help because we cannot stand seeing the situation, the human rights situation as it is. Q. German politicians discussed today a lot about the reception facilities for migrants in Northern African countries but not Libya, was this discussed and do you find it feasible? If IOM and UNHCR go into the camps in Libya would that be then provide a safe and legal way to the EU ? We did not discuss the presence of camps in other countries in North Africa. My advice would be to be very careful with that, because our effort is to stabilise and strengthen the resilience of countries around Libya, starting from Tunisia, and we need to take care of their fragile, still, economic and social situation, not to mention the security situation. But we did not discuss that. It was not an option that came to the table in our conversation today, nor in the Malta Summit on Friday, nor in the preparation of our works. On the second question, for sure, when the UNHCR manages to operate in the centres and then identifies someone as someone in need and having the right to international protection, then the UNHCR starts a resettlement programme and those persons are resettled, be it in Europe, be it in Canada or in the United States – that I do not know - or elsewhere in the world. But again, here, it is more for the UNHCR to answer. Our way, and I would like this to be very clear, is managing the flows, it is not the wall, it is not keeping people out, it is a different way, it is a European way of managing something that is extremely complicated to manage, putting human lives, human rights and the fight against the criminal organisations first. And this goes together with a partnership and the cooperation with the countries: countries of origins, countries of transit, and strong partnership and cooperation with UNHCR, IOM and UN system. So it is a completely opposite manner than others that you are seeing around these days. Q. On Russia's role in the Mediterranean – threat or chance to stabilise Libya? On Egypt : is there a migration compact in the pipeline ? No, on this question no, clearly not. We have with Egypt partnership priorities discussed. Egypt is one of the countries that fall under the neighbourhood policy instrument we have, sorry this becomes a bit technical but you are from the ""Brussels' bubble"" by definition so you know what I am referring to, so what we have with Egypt is the effort, the common effort to establish a dialogue that is quite specific but that has instruments that are within the frame of our bilateral relationship which is that of a neighbouring country. And on Russia I discussed this not only with the Ministers today but most of all with [Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey] Lavrov on Friday. We discussed mainly about, as I said, Ukraine, Libya, but also Syria that was not on the agenda today. These were the three main issues we discussed. And both on Libya and Syria, we decided to find ways to join efforts and cooperate. We will discuss more at length and in-depth - I believe next week we will have a bilateral meeting - to try to facilitate, as I said, [Khalifa] Haftar and [Prime Minister of Libya Fayez al-]Sarraj coming together. We have a clear point of view, as you know. We fully support the work of Prime Minister Sarraj and the Presidency Council but again we are ready to accompany any process wanted by the Libyans and on the basis of the Libyan Political Agreement and on the basis of the international legitimacy enshrined in the UN system, that could help uniting the country. And if we can work together with the Russians in that respect that can only be a positive thing but we will have to see if and to what extend this could be possible. Q. Do you already know who and when you are going to meet in Washington later this week? What it will be the main messages that you will convey to them apart from the two-State solution and probably the location of the embassies in Israel. The location of our embassy is not going to change so I have nothing to report on that. I think the programme is still in the making. I am going to have meetings for sure in the Congress, the White House and we are finalising the others. But I am sure that my team can share tonight, or tomorrow the information on the meetings that I am going to have, which I don’t have in mind now. But in any case I am meeting General Flynn, [White House Advisor, Jared] Kushner, and several Senators and Congressman, and we are in the making of arranging meetings with [U.S. Secretary of State, Rex] Tillerson and [US Defence Secretary, James] Mattis, either in Washington or in Europe depending on the time management. But as I told you, we have now two weeks and a half: my visit now to Washington will be the first round of visits - not complete; then a second round of meetings in Brussels, Bonn, Munich next week, and then a third element of the visit of Vice-President [Mike] Pence here in Brussels to the European institutions and NATO. So in the next two weeks, I will have a complete round of meetings with my U.S. interlocutors. And my main message – more than a message, it will be a dialogue hopefully – will be to define common ground, on which files we want to cooperate strongly together; on other files there might be divergences, so I would expect that we would go on the whole list of files and see, on our side, on the basis of the clear EU positions, where our interests and views converge; in what way we can work together, and especially on the things on which for the European Union it is a priority that the international community manages to work together: an efficient UN system, implementation of the climate change agreement, the Middle East, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and I could continue with a few others. So we will have a full range of issues to discuss, but I am particularly happy – I have to tell you – that some of our meetings will take place in Washington, some others will take place in Europe and in Brussels and I particularly value the visit of Vice-President [Mike] Pence to the European institutions. I think this is a very important political sign as well. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I132972 Bruxelles"
Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council,06.02.2017,06.02.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/19978_en,,"Check against delivery!  We will have today, as always, a very intense Foreign Affairs Council. We will start with the situation in Ukraine that, as you have seen, has deteriorated significantly in the last days. I talked about that with Minister [of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey] Lavrov on Friday - I called him - and yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine [for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, Ivanna Klympush]. We will address with the ministers, first of all, the need for de-escalation of violence in the east, also our continued non-recognition policy of the annexation of Crimea, and also our continued support to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, the Normandy format, the work of the OSCE - as Austria is taking the Chairmanship-in-office, but also our continued support to the reform agenda of the country because we want to invest in social and economic developments that can benefit all Ukrainians. We know that this is a very important part of our work. We will also have a full point of discussion on Libya looking beyond migration, our support to the political process there. I will report to the ministers about my meeting with the Prime Minister [of the Government of National Accord of Libya and Chairman of the Presidency Council, Fayez al-] Serraj last week, on our ongoing work especially in support of the regional efforts to try and bring the country together, strengthen the Government of National Accord, working with the Arab League, the African Union, and the UN, to try and make sure that Libya finds its own way. Then we will also have a point on Egypt. Obviously it is a country with whom we work on all different regional files, starting with Libya but also the Middle East Peace Process and others, as well also our bilateral relations. We will also have another point on the Middle East Peace Process. As you know, the relations between Israel and Palestine and our work on the Middle East Peace Process - especially within the Quartet - continues to be a very high point on our agenda. By the way, I will also be discussing this later this week in Washington. And our work will continue to try and build viable options for two States. I will also take the opportunity today to update ministers on the work we have done in the last couple of weeks on the Dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. We have seen encouraging developments finally in Mitrovica and I will take the opportunity of this meeting today to report to ministers of the developments on the dialogue.  Q. On migration: Libya and [EUNAVFOR Med ] Operation Sophia. What we are seeing is that since last year we saved at sea I think more than 32,000 people, only with [EUNAVFOR Med ] Operation Sophia. But we also have seen that 4500 people have died in Libyan waters. And we have to do something about that - the Libyans have to do something about that, Europeans have to do something about that. We believe that the international community together has to do something about that and you cannot just close your eyes, because people are continuing to die, regardless that our efforts in the international waters are paying off in terms of results. We do not operate in Libyan waters, as you know. We are trying to increase also the work in the desert, because we continue to face a tragic loss of life in the desert. Not seeing this happening, we believe, is irresponsible. So what we are trying to do is strengthening the Libyan capacities to save lives, to protect people, including the people who are currently in Libya, living in camps in awful conditions and bringing the IOM [International Organisation for Migration] and the UNHCR [UN Refugee Agency] to work inside Libya to improve the conditions. We believe this is a responsibility towards human beings who are living in terrible conditions in this moment. So it is a way of strengthening the capacities of the Libyans, including on human rights, to manage a situation that is very complicated and difficult for us - imagine for a country that is coming out of such a long crisis - and giving the Libyans instruments to exercise their sovereignty on their country, including, as I said on this, for us, human rights' priority. Q. What plan do you have regarding the Iraqi situation? That is not on the agenda today. Q. On Ukraine: can we see a link between what is happening there and the change of the US administration? It is not for me to speculate on that. What is clear is that from the European Union, the clarity we have: on the illegal annexation of Crimea which we will continue not to recognise; and the need to fully implement the Minsk agreements, starting from a ceasefire and restoring calm or bringing calm to the east of Ukraine, is a must. The European Union will reaffirm, I believe, today this strong position and will work with all partners, including in the Normandy format that incudes also Ukraine and Russia to find a way to solve the conflict. I cannot say where the US administration stands on that but I can say where the Europeans stand on this. Thank you. Q. When will a decision be taken on the finalisation of the decision on visa-free travel for the citizens of Georgia? This is also not on the agenda but as you know very well, I really hope that we can finalise this issue as soon as possible, not only for Georgia but also for Ukraine. Thank you, I will see you later.  Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I133210  Bruxelles"

This decision of the Constitutional Court to declare the European Court of Human Rights' judgment non-executable is highly regrettable and goes against Russia's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU recalls that the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has consistently held that the payment of just satisfaction as awarded by the European Court of Human Rights is an unconditional obligation of the Contracting Parties. Any attempt by a Contracting Party to pick and choose which rulings of the Court it will implement seriously undermines the unique human rights protection system established by the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU strongly urges Russia to adhere to its obligation under Article 46(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires states to “abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties”. We call upon Russia to continue its dialogue with the Council of Europe on the matter in order to avoid open conflict between the Convention and national constitutional principles. We look forward to proposals in this regard."

2017 Session of the Conference on Disarmament - EU Statement,31.01.2017,31.01.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/19599_en,,"EU Opening Statement 2017 Session of the Conference on Disarmament Mr. President,  I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.  The Candidate Countries the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia*, Montenegro*, Serbia* and Albania*, the country of the Stabilisation and Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia align themselves with this Statement. Let me first congratulate you on the assumption of the post as the first President of the Conference on Disarmament during its 2017 session. We will fully support you in your efforts to achieve a successful start of this session.  We take this opportunity to thank the Secretary General of the United Nations and the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs for their messages last week, and for their commitment and interest in the work of the Conference. We all heard their urgent appeal to the Conference to start long overdue negotiations. The EU and its Member States strongly support this appeal.  Mr. President,  At the outset let me highlight that 16 January 2017 marked the first anniversary of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), agreed between China, Germany, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union as coordinator and Iran. One year after the beginning of the implementation period, it is clear that the JCPOA , which was designed to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme, is bringing tangible benefits to all. While recognising the concrete progress achieved so far, we underline the need to continue to ensure the full and effective implementation throughout the entire lifetime of the JCPOA. The EU has clearly affirmed its commitment to this objective and will continue to work hand in hand with all those willing to contribute to its full implementation and to achieving the objectives which brought us together.  The Iran nuclear deal is a multilateral endeavour, endorsed by the UN Security Council, demonstrating that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions even to the most pressing proliferation challenges. In the same vein, we hope that CD members will work together to embark in serious negotiations that will benefit international peace, security and stability.  The Conference on Disarmament remains the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum and should fulfil its crucial role to negotiate multilateral disarmament treaties according to its mandate . Its continued relevance is of utmost importance for the European Union. While we appreciate the efforts of the past CD Presidencies to break the deadlock and reach agreement on a Programme of Work, the long-awaited breakthrough has not been achieved. Renewed efforts are required to reach agreement and this will continue to require substantial political will and creative thinking from all CD members.  The EU and its Member States welcome the efforts of the Romanian CD Presidency to bring the CD back to substantive work. The proposed Way Ahead Working Group and Informal Thematic Working Groups, which would work for the whole period of the 2017 session, would give continuity to our work and enable open discussions to identify issues of commonality and points of divergence on current and new issues of interest.  In this context, we would like to reiterate EU Member States' longstanding commitment to the enlargement of the Conference. We underline the importance of furthering substantive consultations on the expansion of its membership and strongly support the appointment of a special coordinator in this respect.  We also encourage enhanced interaction between civil society and the CD and we hope that further steps towards broadened contribution of NGOs, academia and research institutions can be taken. We take note of the intention of Secretary General Michael Moeller to organise the next Civil Society Forum in 2018.  For the European Union, the immediate commencement and early conclusion of the negotiation in the Conference on Disarmament of a Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, on the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein, remains a clear priority. We call on all CD members to start negotiations on such a Treaty without delay and to begin work on the other issues on the agenda in line with the adopted Programme of Work CD/1864. We call on all States possessing nuclear weapons that have not done so to declare and uphold an immediate moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  The EU and its Member States supported the 2016 UN General Assembly Resolution on FMCT, which was presented by Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. We hope that the work to be carried out by the high level expert preparatory group, complemented by open ended consultative meetings, will bring the Conference on Disarmament closer to negotiations on this important issue, which would significantly strengthen the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation architecture.  The EU and its Member States also supported the 2016 UN General Assembly Resolution on Nuclear Disarmament Verification and we welcome the establishment of the Group of Governmental Experts to consider the role of verification in advancing nuclear disarmament. While verification is not an aim in itself, further development of the multilateral nuclear disarmament verification capabilities will be required for the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons.  The EU recognises that negative security assurances strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and calls on all nuclear weapon States to reaffirm existing security assurances noted by relevant UN Security Council resolutions.  The EU and its Member States continue to promote the preservation of a safe and secure space environment and the peaceful use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. We remain convinced that Transparency and Confidence Building Measures can make an important contribution to the security, safety and sustainability of activities in outer space to preserve the integrity of space environment for all. This is the reason why the EU proposed some years ago an international code of conduct for outer space activities. The EU continues to believe that a non-legally binding agreement negotiated within the United Nations could be a way to proceed. Globally shaped principles of responsible behaviour across the full range of space activities should serve long term goals: to increase international cooperation in space, to commit mutually to non-interference in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, to facilitate an equitable access to outer space and increase transparency in the conduct of space activities. The EU and its Member States will continue to show commitment in these areas, which are important to our security and prosperity.  Mr. President,  For the European Union, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with Article VI of the NPT and an important element in the further development of nuclear energy applications for peaceful purposes. A new review cycle is starting this May. Our priority is to uphold and preserve the NPT as a key multilateral instrument for reinforcing international peace, security and stability, promote its universalisation and strengthen its implementation. We call on all States Parties to implement, without delay and in a balanced manner, the 2010 Action Plan designed to strengthen the three pillars of the Treaty. The concrete and mutually reinforcing steps on nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, contained in the Action Plan, will contribute to the objective of achieving a world without nuclear weapons. We will fully support the Chairs of the NPT Preparatory Committee in their endeavours for a successful review cycle.  The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of crucial importance to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and its entry into force and universalisation remain top priorities for the EU. Twenty years after the opening of the CTBT for signature, we welcome the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2310, its first ever CTBT specific resolution, as a decisive development. The EU and its Member States, all ratifying States of the CTBT, call upon all States to refrain from conducting any nuclear weapon test explosion and urge all States that have yet to sign or ratify the CTBT, in particular the eight remaining Annex 2 States, to do so without further delay.  The EU strongly condemns the nuclear tests and the ballistic missile launches which were conducted in 2016 by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in clear violation of its international obligations under multiple UN Security Council Resolutions. These activities represent a serious threat to international peace and security and undermine the global non-proliferation and disarmament regime. They also underline the necessity of universalisation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We again urge the DPRK to re-engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community, in particular in the framework of the Six-Party Talks, to abide by all its international obligations and abandon its nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction and existing nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease immediately all related activities.   Thank you, Mr. President. Geneva"
WTO rules in favour of the EU in dispute on Russian duties on light commercial vehicles,30.01.2017,30.01.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/19460_en,,"A World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel today declared as illegal the Russian anti-dumping duties that hinder exports of Italian and German light commercial vehicles (LCVs). The panel ruled that Russia failed to observe a number of WTO rules when introducing the anti-dumping duties in 2013, which range from 23% to nearly 30% and affect exports of Italian and German vehicles. This is just one example of multiple measures taken by Russia in the recent years against EU exports. The panel's findings remind Russia that its international obligations cannot be ignored. ""I am glad to see a very clear ruling by the WTO against one of the unfair, protectionist and anti-competitive measures that we see today in Russia. The duties on light commercial vehicles are not in line with commitments by Russia at the time it joined the WTO. Those measures now have to be removed. I hope to see Russia honouring its international obligations and respecting this ruling without delay "", said Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström . The panel agreed with the EU on all procedural claims and recognised several problems with the analysis by Russia that led to the introduction of duties. By excluding certain domestic producers from their calculations, the Russian authorities based their analysis of the damage allegedly caused to the domestic industry on unrealistic figures. While assessing the effects of the alleged dumping, the authorities disregarded another factor: the overcapacity in the Russian LCV sector, which stood at that time at seven times what is actually sold on the Russian market. The parties have 60 days to appeal the decision. Otherwise, Russia will be expected to remove its anti-dumping duties on LCVs from the EU. Background The anti-dumping duties on light commercial vehicles, introduced in May of 2013, target imports from Germany, Italy and Turkey. The measures concern light commercial vehicles between 2.8 tonnes to 3.5 tonnes in weight, van-type bodies and diesel engines with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 3.000 cm 3 , designed for the transport of cargo of up to two tonnes or for the combined transport of cargo and passengers. The measures were adopted by the Eurasian Economic Union and currently apply on imports to all its countries, i.e. Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. If they are removed, there will be no such anti-dumping duties on imports from those EU Member States into any of the members of the Eurasian Economic Union. The case concerns Russia specifically, given that at the time the EU brought the case to the WTO in 2014, Russia was the only member of the Eurasian Economic Union bound by the WTO rules. This is one of four WTO disputes that the EU has had to bring against Russia since its accession to the WTO. The other cases concern an import ban on pigs and pork products, excess tariffs on imports of paper and other products, and a recycling fee on cars. In the cases of excess tariffs and the pork ban , two WTO panels found in 2016 that Russian measures were violating the WTO rules.

Remarks by Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Ministerial meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean,23.01.2017,23.01.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/19076_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Ministerial meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean Check against delivery!  First of all, let me apologise for the delay but it has been a very intense, very positive and constructive morning of work with our Ministerial Meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean here in Barcelona. Let me start by saying that it has been – and it is – an honour for me to co-chair this annual gathering of Foreign Ministers in the Union for the Mediterranean with the new Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ayman Safadi. We already became friends and I am sure that we will continue to work together, not only bilaterally but also as co-chairs of the Union for the Mediterranean as the European Union and Jordan have been doing in these last years. I want also to take this opportunity to salute and thank his predecessor, Mr Nasser Judeh, with whom we worked in an excellent manner all over these years; but as I said, we have already started an excellent cooperation with Ayman. Since 2012, the economic regional cooperation has been the core of business of the Union for the Mediterranean. This means working with concrete projects on education, jobs creation and economic sustainable development. And we have delivered already concrete results, direct benefits for the young people, women, entrepreneurs and citizens in our region. I am sure the Secretary General [of the Union for the Mediterranean, Mr. Fathallah Sijilmassi] will be more detailed in presenting the results of this work, but let me tell just that having 43 countries, an overall population of 800 million people in our region, gives us a size, a magnitude, an impact that is quite unique and the 47 – if I am not wrong - regional projects labelled with € 5,5 billion supporting this is really a very concrete outcome of hard work, not only of the Secretariat, but also of our teams and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the teams that have been working also for this Ministerial that has brought, I think, big and important results. I will close by saying that in terms of political results of this meeting today, I believe we have made a very important collective commitment today with all the Ministers and the representatives around the table. It is more and more evident in our region that the way to solve conflicts, manage crises, prevent tensions is more regional integration and more regional cooperation. This is the most conflictual region of the world and it is also the less integrated one. The two things have a connexion and the European history has shown us over decades, if not over centuries, that the less integration, the less cooperation you have at regional level, the more conflicts you are likely to have and, on the other side, the more conflicts and tensions you have, the more difficult cooperation and integration become. So, today we have committed together to break this circle of lack of integration and tensions and conflituality and invest in a coherent manner on more political dialogue and more regional integrational cooperation on very concrete fields of actions through our Union for the Mediterranean. This is going to have an impact on our citizens' lives and the special focus of our deliberations today has been the focus on youth. We know well, as the demographic trends of our region indicate that this is the smart thing to do for our present and not only for our future; but also tackling the issue of giving adequate space to our youth, both in Europe and in the rest of the Mediterranean region, is also key to a certain number of top priorities that we share: the economic development, guaranteeing that our societies are open societies with a space for each and every citizen, the management of migration flows but also the prevention of radicalisation and the management of our security concerns that we also share. So, our decision today is this, to sum up in short, and I stop here: increase our political cooperation, increase our common work on concrete projects for regional integration and cooperation with a special focus on youth, and try to use this to create more stability and more peace in the region. I would like to thank all my friends here on stage with me, and in particular to the Spanish government, all my friends, the [Spanish] Foreign Minister Alfonso [Dastis] for having welcomed us as always in an excellent manner in Spain. Gracias. And I give the floor to my co-chair, the Jordanian Foreign Minister, [Ayman Safadi].  Q&A  Q. Comment les principes vont-ils être concrétisés ? Et ce que vous avez décidé aujourd'hui engage-t-il les autres membres de l'UpM ? Que dire aux gens pour leur prouver que des choses concrètes sont faites?  A: Si je peux ajouter une petite chose, pour être très concrète, déjà l'Union pour la Méditerranée, ensemble, cela veut dire nous ensemble, les 43 membres, avec le soutien du Secretariat, le travail du Secrétariat, par exemple sur la question de l'emploi des jeunes, nous sommes arrivés à avoir 26 projets avec un impact sur 200 000 jeunes dans la région. C'est quelque chose de très concret, l'exemple du lac de Bizerte c'est seulement un des exemples, des projets qui touchent à l'emploi mais aussi à la gestion de la pollution, sur le climat, l'énergie – comment dit-on en français ? ""renewable "" – renouvelable, le transport, la gestion des espaces et de développement urbains, et cela touche vraiment la vie des gens. Et si je peux ajouter une chose: on voit toujours la nécessité de créer des liens entre les deux côtés de la Méditerranée mais si l'on regarde par exemple le commerce dans la région on se rend compte que 90% de ce commerce a lieu à l'intérieur de l'Union européenne, 9% entre l'Union européenne et le reste de la région et seulement 1% de commerce sur le côté Sud; c’est-à-dire à l'intérieur d'un même côté de la Méditerranée. Et c'est pour cela que l'intégration régionale est tellement importante pour le développement économique, pour le développement social, mais aussi pour la sécurité parce que la coopération économique est aussi une forte, très forte base, pour la coopération d'un point de vue de la paix et de la sécurité. Q. On the new U.S. administration and on the EU-US cooperation, in particular regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A: It is some 20 questions in one, but I will try. First of all, the European Union is more than ready and willing to cooperate with the new U.S. administration on the basis of our own policies, our own priorities and our own values, so I can say I do not know if this is ‘Europe first’, but for sure I see a lot fields where American and European interests coincide. And we will define with the new administration - once all the teams are settled in their respective ministries, their set of priorities and policies – some of them are still in definition and in the making, this is normal - policies and priorities and see where we have coinciding policies, coinciding interests where we have space for intense cooperation. I am convinced that especially on counter-terrorism, security but also on some of the conflict we have in the region, in the Mediterranean, we will have a common interest to cooperate as well as we have cooperated always with the last U.S. administration. There will be issues where probably our interests will not coincide, but it is not for me to spell out the U.S. policies before the new administration will. The EU positions are clear and well known on many different issues, including on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By the way this morning I had the chance of meeting here both with the Israeli Minister for Regional Cooperation [Tzachi Hanegbi] and the Palestinian Foreign Minister [Riyad al-Maliki] and we discussed not only bilateral issues, but also the EU support for the restart of direct negotiations. I have seen that this is also the affirmed position of the Trump administration: the support to direct talks. This is exactly the position that the European Union has always had. We will see for actions but – and this is not up to us to determine the direction that these actions or these policies will take – for sure the European Union policies are clear and we will work with the U.S. administration on the basis of our own positions that are determined as you know in Brussels or elsewhere we meet at 28. I would just like to say that again, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the European Union approach is that of trying to help the parties to find a common ground, to achieve the two-state solution. This is our aim and we will continue to work, hopefully with our partners in the Quartet – U.S., Russia and the United Nations –, with our Arab Partners – Jordan, Egypt, other countries, the Arab League - on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative that for us is a very good basis to start with, and first and foremost with the parties. We have strong ties both with Israel and with Palestine and this is a plus that the European Union puts at the service of the international community to try and facilitate a positive solution to the conflict. Because when we talk about the need to focus on the youth or on the economic cooperation in the region, this also includes Israel and Palestine. And we see the need, especially when sharing such a small portion of land, to have cooperation, based on steps on the ground that can make life easier for the people on all sides. Bruxelles"
Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,16.01.2017,16.01.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/18655_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council Check against delivery!  We've had the Foreign Affairs Council with the [Foreign] Ministers. We focused mainly on two issues as you probably know. First of all our work on Syria: I presented to the ministers the first outcome, the first results of the EU regional initiative for the future of Syria, focusing with the regional powers on the future asset of a political transition, of elements of reconciliation and reconstruction, in an initiative that, as you might recall, started few months ago. And we have had just last week bilateral meetings here in Brussels to discuss several elements for a political transition with the delegations from most of the countries in the region - from Saudi Arabia to Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, [United Arab] Emirates - and we are going to have similar meetings in the coming days with another number of countries of the region to feed into the UN-led process, possibly to provide some elements already for the February intra-Syrian talks to be held in Geneva. I discussed this last week in Geneva with Staffan de Mistura [UN Special Envoy for Syria] and António Guterres [UN Secretary General], so working hand-in-hand with the UN on the political side of the efforts to bring a solution the Syrian conflict.  We discussed this with the ministers. I updated them on this EU-led initiative and I shared with them the plans to convene in Brussels together with the UN a conference on the future of Syria, in the spring, that we would co-chair possibly also with others. It will have two main objectives. On one side taking stock of the implementation of commitments of the donors’ community of the London Conference. You might remember that it has taken place last year on which the European Union has delivered in full, being the first humanitarian donor worldwide for Syria and for the Syrians in the region. But most of all it will be – and can - a political conference, hoping that could be the moment, a few months after the restart of the intra-Syrian talks in Geneva under UN auspices, for the international community to together turn the page and start the political transition, the reconciliation process and the reconstruction of Syria on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. And again these are all elements that we will continue to elaborate in strong connection with the UN and with the UN Special Envoy and with the perspective of supporting, facilitating, feeding into the work that the UN is doing on the intra-Syrian talks, because our approach is this: trying to facilitate a regional understanding of the future of Syria, to create the space for the Syrians themselves to decide on their own future.  The second point we discussed with the Ministers was the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP), the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The Council today strongly reconfirmed our consolidated EU position on the two States and on the trends that are endangering this perspective, as we outlined also in the Quartet Report and in the recommendations that are included in the report, namely the three elements I also mentioned yesterday in Paris: the settlement expansion, the violence and the incitement to violence, and the situation in Gaza.  I was in Paris yesterday, representing the European Union, as well as all the Member States were present in Paris. I signed up  to the declaration that reflects fully the EU's consolidated position that you can find in several EU Council Conclusions – the last substantial ones, very substantial ones, date from more or less one year ago where you will still find all elements of policy that we reconfirmed today. If you want I can go more into detail, but that covers the full range of policies and positions that we reconfirmed today. As I said, the Paris Declaration reflects fully the EU's consolidated position that we reconfirmed today as well as the UN Security Council resolution that was adopted at the end of December fully represents the EU's consolidated position, as we have several times stated.  We also discussed - and this was the main focus of the discussion - the way forward for the EU's work on the MEPP. We had a brainstorming on how we can try to bring forward the work, first of all, with the direct involvement of the parties. The European Union is fully convinced that only through a full commitment and involvement and determination of the parties there can be a negotiation that is meaningful and leads to a solution, a real solution. No one can substitute this process, but we can facilitate and provide space and international framework for this to happen in the best conditions. This is what we have done last year with the Quartet; this is what we are eager to do and continue to do with our partners, starting from the United Nations, the United States and Russia in the Quartet. But also, and I would even say mainly, in some cases our Arab partners and we discussed this at length just a couple of weeks ago in Cairo with the Arab League and the Arab League’s Member States, starting from Egypt but also all the other Arab countries on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative.  So, these were the two main issues we discussed, on which we found a profound and useful unity that is going to be the basis for the work. On Syria, as I told you, continuing our EU initiative, continuing to link up with other initiatives that are looking more at the military aspects of the crisis and that we welcome. On the MEPP, trying obviously to continue to enlarge or to at least consolidate an international unity that can be the basis for the parties to directly re-engage.  We also had some other points of discussion with the ministers, focusing on priorities we will face in this beginning of the year; and I am happy to elaborate on any of those you want to raise. I especially updated them on the negotiations on the Cyprus issue. As you know, the European Union was taking part to the Conference on Cyprus last week in Geneva as a special observer with a special status, being an interested party, and we continue to do that work on the name of the European Union entirely. I stop here and I am ready to take some questions.  Q&A  Q. Regarding the MEPP, what is your opinion on the conference of Paris? Do you think that such an event was useful given that the two main parties were not at the table and also with all the rumours around the possible moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? I don’t know if this was discussed. I know that on your way in you did not want to comment specifically on it, but is this something that the US should avoid in a moment that the US policy vis-à-vis the Middle East is not clear? The second question is concerning the conference on Syria: can we expect that for the beginning of April?   A: We can expect it for spring, we are working for April. Obviously we are liaising strictly with the UN to be in synch, but that could be for April. On the conference in Paris I think it was useful as a moment of gathering a large international community and reconfirming the commitment of the international community to the two-state solution, keeping this as the top priority of the international community. For the European Union this is nothing new because it has always been and it continues to be a high priority for us every single time and, as I said, consolidated EU positions were reflected in that. So to us what is key is that there is internationally a framework that encourages and facilitates a situation where the parties can re-engage directly. When it comes to Jerusalem – yes, we discussed that for sure -, the European Union will continue to respect international consensus embodied in the UN Security Council resolution 478 of 1980. We will not move our EU Delegation that is in Tel Aviv and we hope that there can be a reflection on consequences of any move that is taken. We still do not have a new US administration – we have an administration in the US, not a new one yet. And I believe that it is very important for us to refrain from unilateral actions, especially those that can have serious consequences in large of public opinions in large parts of the world.  Q. I understand that Britain essentially blocked a statement on the MEPP today which would have welcomed the past conclusions. I wondered if you could comment on that and if you think that is in line with what Mr [Boris] Johnson [UK Foreign Secretary] has been saying in recent months that Britain would continue to cooperate closely and not stop the EU taking its own decisions on foreign policy. Secondly, just on Jerusalem, what is the consequence if the US makes the decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem?  A : On the first part of the question: no, this does not correspond to what happened in the room. We had an informal exchange on this issue. You know that we always have one part of our Council that is an informal session, so maybe that contributes to spreading rumours which sometimes have a little bit of fantasy in it. The main focus of our discussion was - as I said - the consensus we have, so no divisions on that, unity on the consolidated positions of the European Union on the MEPP and the perspectives of our future work to create conditions for both - international unity and the parties - to work usefully in the future.  There were some exchanges around the table on whether it would have been useful or not to have short Council Conclusions today. They were some different views, not on the content, but on the opportunity to have them on not, and in which form. And normally, as you know, Council conclusions are prepared in advance and normally we do not decide them over an informal session on the spot. I do not exclude that we can have Council conclusions on the Middle East, and on the way forward of our work especially on the Quartet and our work with the Arab partners in relation to the MEPP in the future. But that will have to be obviously not only prepared, but also probably taken at a stage where things are a little bit more mature on the side of the new US administration when it comes to their own vision that for the moment is not yet clear, especially on the role of the Quartet. So, no, Boris [Johnson] did not stop or prevent any decision of the European Union. On the contrary, as always, he participated fully to all the points of the agenda, and we had a normal Council.  On Jerusalem: I cannot foresee today what could be a reaction or consequences to a decision or an action that is not yet taken. So it would be an ""if/if"" answer which is something that - as you know well - I never do. For sure, I am worried that large parts, as I say, of not only institutions but public opinion in parts of the world that are quite significant - the Arab world but also Africa, Asia, parts of Europe - could have in reaction to a move that for sure would not be in line with, as I said, the international consensus embodied in the UN Security Council Resolutions, especially 478.  Q. Regarding the consultation you are having with the regional partners on the future of Syria, can you tell us what is your own vision regarding the future state of Syria. Should it be a secular one, an un-confessional one or a civilian one? On Morocco, last December the [European] Court of Justice issued an attesting decision dictating that the partnership should be between the European Union and Morocco but it should not be implemented on the Western Sahara. How will you deal with this complex issue?  A . On this you can refer to the joint statement I published that very same day with the Moroccan Foreign Minister [Mr Salaheddine Mezouar]. The very same fact that we reacted together to that pronouncement is in itself, I believe, in content and in symbolism, a sign of our strong determination to work in partnership. And for what concerns the legal aspects of the consequences of that decision - obviously we are still, our legal services are still, considering all the different implications - I can say that, again, our partnership with the Moroccan authorities has been excellent in reacting together and following together the decisions taken and I am sure that it will constitute a good basis for our relations to move to a different stage - that of a stronger partnership, even stronger partnership.  On Syria: the reason why the European Union is well-positioned to work on this initiative, on the political future of Syria, is not only the leverage that we can have on the economic reconstruction - which is a significant one -, but it is most of all, I believe, the fact that we have not been part of the conflict, we do not have our own political agenda for the country. But we do have an interest that is based on the relevant UN Security Council resolutions – so purely on the international legal approach and consensus – on having a united Syria, a Syria that is in peace and that builds a society where all citizens of Syria, regardless of their background, of their religion, of their ethnicity, of their political believes, can feel ownership – not only be respected as minorities but feel ownership of the country. This will require probably profound transformation of the institutional system but also the societal dynamics.  Syria is not the only country in the region that used to be a place of different communities living together. It still has the potential to be so and this is the only agenda the European Union has. One: to fulfil the UN Security Council resolutions that are relevant to it; second, to build a place or to help to build a place where all Syrians can feel home - those who are still in Syria, those who would like to go back to Syria -; and third, a country that can live in good cooperation, in peace, with all the neighbouring countries.  This is why we can be honest brokers in the region, making sure that all the regional powers - starting from the Arab countries - feel comfortable with the process of turning the page of the Syrian conflict. Because we know well that in the region, it is the regional powers, it is the regional countries, it is the neighbouring countries – and among them I put Europe - we have to make sure that we will be in the political conditions of supporting a transition in Syria. This has to be prepared. Too many times we have not prepared post-conflicts. This is what we are doing now, preparing politically the transition. As I said several times, the military arrangements for a cessation of hostilities are not something that concern the European Union in terms of our active involvement because we are not a military player on the ground. This gives us also the credibility with the Syrian people, all of them, because we have not been there engaged military on the ground, we are there for a political solution, for humanitarian support and we will try to help as much as we can but obviously for us one thing is clear: the reconciliation and the reconstruction, comes with the political transition.  Q. Donald Trump said this weekend that he does not care if the European Union splits apart. Can the European Union hold together with a Eurosceptic President in the White House? Are you doing anything special to ensure European unity on the face of a Trump Presidency?  A: I think that the European Union will stick together. I am one hundred per cent convinced of this. I respect the opinion of the future President of the United States, the President-elect - almost President - but I think that the European Union will be ok in the future. And, as you asked this, let me specify one thing because I have seen some interviews coming out in these hours. I would like to specify one thing that we discussed also with Boris Johnson [UK Foreign Minister] today and he was agreeing with me: it is absolutely clear on the European Union side that as long as a country is a Member State of the European Union, which is something that the UK is at the moment, seven months after the referendum still. So maybe this has also to be taken into consideration: seven months after the result of the referendum they are still here and we are still 28. As long as a Member State is a Member State, there are no negotiations bilaterally on any trade agreement with third parties. This is in the treaties and this is valid for all Member States as long as they remain Member States, until the very last day. I think this is fair for me to specify, because this is a framework that we all share, including the United Kingdom in this moment.  Q. It might not been at the FAC [Foreign Affairs Council] today but certainly seems to have been a debate at Coreper over three sentences to do with the Paris Conference that seemed very anodyne indeed and those words did not seem to have the support from at least 25 countries and Britain, if not Boris Johnson - his representative Tim Barrow did make the argument that perhaps this language can be seen as fencing the President-elected before the inauguration, trying to bounce him into a policy decision. Do you regret that sensitivity? I am sure that this is not the best way to show unity and Trump does not seem to be showing any reciprocal or mutual sensitivity when he talked about the EU.  A: It is maybe because I have an Italian political background, my standards of sensitivity are flexible. I think the next U.S. administration will establish with the European Union a political relationship that I wish it was a partnership and I wish it will be a partnership. This is also the direction of our talks with Vice President-elect Mike Pence when we had a conversation about this. These are the signals we are getting, that of a willingness to build partnership and cooperation on the fields where we have mutual interests, from counter-terrorism to economic growth and several other issues around the region and beyond. So many things are not yet clear. I think also for the incoming administration, they will need to take some time and I am respectful of this process. Any transition takes time and I will not comment or elaborate on intentions expressed before they become policies, if not bilaterally, and maybe more quietly than in a press room.  But what we are looking for is a partnership based on common interests with the United States. The European Union has its own solid autonomous strong policies that - as I said several times - are not determined elsewhere than in the places where the European Union members states and European institutions meet, which is Brussels or somewhere else where we have our informal meetings. We always like to be in good company but we determine our policies by ourselves. The more common ground we find the better, because this will bring better results to our common causes. But there might be issues where we might disagree; it has happened in the past, it might happen in the future. This will have to be seen, once the administration is in place and takes decisions, that is not the case yet. We still have another administration in place.  On the Council Conclusions on the MEPP, as I said, but I can repeat it: today we had an informal discussion on the EU work on the MEPP and especially with the parties. The European Union is the first interlocutor both for Israel and the Palestinians on many different fields, starting from economic cooperation or financial support, to political talks. Our links with the two are strong and put on us a responsibility that we want to exercise at full. This was the point of discussion today. This is the main focus of our work which is a serious work, a daily work that we do, especially through the work of our EU Special Representative for the MEPP [Fernando] Gentilini who was here with us today. I would not go into comments of other dynamics that were not subjects of our meeting today. You do not expect my press conference to comment on the work of the ambassadors in Coreper I guess.  Q: I would like to ask your comment on the tensions that we have seen over the weekend between Belgrade and Pristina over the ""train problem"" so to say, the train that was sent from Belgrade to the north of Kosovo. How do you see the involvement of the two sides, the tensions and the nature of the [EU-facilitated] dialogue [for the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina] at this moment and how it will continue in the future?  A: I was personally not only following the issue of the train over the weekend, but also personally in touch; as you are from a Serbian media you know probably that I was in contact with Prime Minister [Aleksandar] Vučić, extremely worried about the situation that could have easily escalated. And my message to the parties has been to avoid escalations, trying to contain both acts and rhetoric and trying to see the common engagement through the Dialogue as something that is delivering for both. Not necessarily, or not so much for both institutions, but for both peoples, because the steps we have taken both with Belgrade and with Pristina last year are historical. And we managed to move so far and so much on the EU perspective of the entire region, also because we have managed to build on a positive Dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. This requires sometimes political courage – I know that well – political leadership, political vision. We are here to help and facilitate. So the question about the perspectives of the dialogue is a question you should rather ask in Belgrade or in Pristina. But what I see is from the both sides a determination to continue. To me what is really important today is to make this process continue to deliver for the people; and agreements already reached implemented on the ground on both sides which is again sometimes involving difficult decisions, but I think this is a choice that was done knowing exactly what it was entailing for good reasons on both sides. The tensions are still high, we constantly see it, but the work I see and the determination I see from the leadership both in Pristina and in Belgrade is a strong one. And as you are from Serbian media, let me thank Prime Minister Vučić for the leadership he has shown in some difficult moments that I think is providing a good basis for him to continue to pursue the interest of his country, of his people and of the region through the dialogue.

Statement by Federica Mogherini on the first Anniversary of the Implementation of the JCPOA,16.01.2017,16.01.2017,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/18609_en,,"Statement by the High-Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini on the first Anniversary of the Implementation of the JCPOA The 16th of January marks the first anniversary of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), agreed between the European Union, China, Germany, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and Iran. One year after the beginning of the implementation period, it is clear that the JCPOA is working for all. In the course of this year, JCPOA participants have powerfully demonstrated their full commitment to respect and implement the deal. The seriousness with which they have done so sends a reassuring signal to the international community of Iran's adherence to a civilian nuclear programme exclusively for peaceful purposes. It also conveys an important and encouraging message to the Iranian government and people. Iran has delivered on its nuclear related commitments as confirmed by the four reports issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is now a key pillar of a strengthened international non-proliferation agenda. For their part, the UN, EU and US have lifted their nuclear-related economic sanctions as promised in the Agreement. As a result there has been a surge in bilateral trade and investment with Iran, contributing to better living prospects for the benefit of all.The full and effective implementation throughout the entire lifetime of the JCPOA remains essential. As coordinator of the work of the Joint Commission, through the High Representative's role, the EU has clearly affirmed its resolute commitment to this objective. The rigorous implementation of commitments by all sides is the best way to continue to build trust, to strengthen the JCPOA and to overcome the hurdles that are part of all comprehensive and far-reaching deals. The JCPOA is a multilateral endeavour, achieved through diplomatic means and endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution. It was born out of the efforts of the E3/EU+3 and Iran, but it now belongs to the entire international community. The JCPOA provides benefits for all and creates opportunities for improved regional cooperation that should be seized by all. The EU will continue to work hand in hand with all those willing to contribute to its full implementation and in achieving the objectives which brought us together.   Bruxelles"

This listing, made on 4 October 2016, brings the number of Memorial-affiliated NGOs included in the registry to eight and the number of Russian NGOs currently registered to 149. The European Union has repeatedly stated that the law on ""foreign agents"" and the ensuing fines, inspections and stigmatisation, further tighten the restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms in Russia, consume the scarce resources of NGOs and inhibit independent civil society in the country. We continue to call on the Russian authorities to align their policies and legislation with the human rights obligations and commitments that they have undertaken, and to abandon the practice of branding Russian NGOs as ""foreign agents"", as well as all resulting administrative harassment. Despite existing difficulties, the European Union is committed to continuing its support for Russian NGOs and civil society. The work of the different Memorial branches, which together form the biggest and oldest network of NGOs, has been and continues to be of the utmost importance for the promotion of human rights in Russia and the preservation of its historical memory.

Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival to the European Council,15.12.2016,15.12.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/17338_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival to the European Council Check against delivery! Good morning. First of all, on Syria - we are working day and night literally to try to guarantee the protection of civilians first of all in East Aleppo. I just spoke on the phone now with the Iranian Foreign Minister [Mohammad Javad] Zarif to urge Iran as well as we are working with the UN and the others to call on the Russian and Syrian authorities, the Iranians to uphold to their responsibilities and to protect civilians in these hours. hope that his can happen and that the same can happen to other civilians who are currently besieged in other areas of the country. For us what is happening to civilians in this moment is completely unacceptable and our priority in this moment is this: protection of civilians. And we are behind the delivery of all humanitarian aid that is currently trying to be delivered by the UN. I talked during the night with Staffan de Mistura [UN Special Envoy for Syria]. We are trying really to make the best and trying to make things move concretely on the ground. And then, as you know, we have the European Union’s initiative to work on the political transition in Syria, the reconciliation and the reconstruction, but first of all you need something to build on and this starts with the protection of civilians, the cessation of hostilities, the ceasefire and a political transition in Damascus. So we are working by the hour, especially with our contacts and with all the regional players to try and create better conditions on the ground. The European Council today will also focus on two other elements I will present to the Heads of State and Government: the report on the Migration Compacts that are going well and having the first results. I was this morning with the President of Niger, [Mahamadou] Issoufou. Niger is a model country in this respect. We are cooperating extremely well and we are seeing the first results: compared to the 70.000 irregular migrants who were crossing the country a few months ago, today we are at 1500 with many traffickers arrested, vehicles ceased. So the cooperation is going well, also the cooperation through the IOM as well because it is the international agencies, the UN agencies, that we are working for assisting migrants all along the routes, so that they are informed and that voluntary return can happen most of all that their human rights are protected from those who are smuggling human beings and putting them in danger in the desert and at sea. The second big element of the European Council today will be the package on security and defence. I will present to the Heads of State and Government a package formed by 3 pillars that we have prepared in these months. First of all, implementation of the Global Strategy, some concrete proposals on how to use the instruments we already have, from the Permanent Structured Cooperation to the use of the Battlegroups or how to better plan and run our missions and operations – we have 16 of them around the world bringing peace and security. I have worked also on the second pillar of this package with the [European] Commission - the European Defence Action Plan supporting European work on the industrial basis of our defence; cooperation especially in the field of industry and research. And the third pillar, the EU-NATO cooperation. [NATO Secretary General] Jens Stoltenberg will be with us today; I was with him last week in NATO announcing 42 concrete proposals for the EU and NATO to cooperate in a very concrete manner, from maritime security to cyber-attacks. So when the Heads of State and Government will today endorse this very substantial package, the European Union will be equipped with a much more credible, strong capacity on security and defence and we will continue to work then with the Defence and Foreign Ministers to implement all these strands of action. Obviously we will also have other issues on the agenda, but these are the three key elements that I will bring to the table on the Council today. Q. On the UK leaving the EU. A. That is not foreign policy yet. Q. On Aleppo: can we expect new sanctions against Russia? A. This has not been the approach that the Council has chosen in its last session. We are working in these hours, as I said, trying to use our influence and our leverage – especially with Iran in this moment – and trying to support the work of the United Nations to try and focus on the protection of civilians. It is clear that the regime and its allies – Russia and Iran – have a responsibility in what has happened and is happening in Aleppo. Our priority today is to try and to make things better on the ground for civilians. This is the priority in these hours and you will see news coming in. We are monitoring them closely on the ground in connection with the United Nations and whatever I say in this moment might not be valid anymore in half an hour, for good and for bad. The important thing in these hours is really our constant work to make the situation better for civilians, especially the children trapped in so many places but especially in East Aleppo. And it is very important that we all focus, the entire international community on improving the situation of civilians in Aleppo to start with, but also in other besieged areas all across the country. Q. Transition in Syria? A. The EU has started this initiative to start working with the regional powers on the transition in Syria. I often say, and I still believe and repeat it: the reality of facts in Syria is such that whatever happens in Aleppo, this would not lead to the end of the conflict. No one has an interest in winning a battle and losing the peace. Syria will have to be at a certain moment in the hands of an inclusive, accountable government; will have to face a difficult process of reconciliation; will have to find ways of including all parts of society in the reconstruction. We will have to mobilise enormous resources for reconstruction and that would be possible only with a true political transition in Damascus. So I believe that everybody realises – and the regional powers in particular realise - that a serious transition is needed and a serious cooperative approach is needed. And a serious transition, inclusive future for the country will be needed. And this cannot be built on the ruins of Aleppo or of other cities. This needs to be prepared with, first of all saving the Syrians. Thanks. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I131231 Bruxelles"
Remarks by Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,12.12.2016,12.12.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/16992_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council Brussels, 12 December 2016 Check against delivery!  Thank you very much. Very briefly because our time is very limited today. I will back in the press room in a while with President [of Colombia, Juan Manuel] Santos who is joining us straight from Oslo and Stockholm after having received the [Nobel] Peace Prize. So I will just mention the issues we discussed with the ministers today. First of all, Africa.  We have decided all together to increase our engagement with all of Africa on many different strands of work really investing in a partnership that is strategic for us Europeans. And next year, it will be for the European Union, an African year with a summit coming up in November and the G20 German Presidency and the G7 Italian Presidency focusing on Africa. We will make sure that our increased work with the continent, and especially with a focus on youth and women, will be strategically carried out from all of us. I also updated the ministers on the implementation of Migration Compacts that I will present to the Heads of State and Government on Thursday at the European Council. We have seen positive trends, some first results so I will share the same assessment with the European Council later this week. We then had a long exchange on Syria where the situation is clearly not positive nor encouraging – to use a euphemism – and we reaffirmed the unity of the European Union on our focus, in particular on the humanitarian track. I said on the last days and I will repeat it here: the European Union is the one that is together with the United Nations delivering and trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Syrians – both inside and around Syria. Still we do not have access to Eastern Aleppo and we urge those who have the responsibility to guarantee access to Eastern Aleppo to allow the humanitarian aid to the civilians. The protection of civilians is the priority for us. But also the work we are doing with the regional powers and players to try and start a political process. For us, it is still very evident that the military dynamic on the ground will not bring an end to the war; it will not probably defeat Da’esh in itself. We will need to have a political transition, some form of power-sharing in Damascus to put an end to the war and this is the focus of our political work with all the regional players. I discussed this last week with both [U.S. Secretary of State] John Kerry and [Foreign Minister of Russia] Sergey Lavrov and obviously constantly with Staffan de Mistura [UN Special Envoy for Syria] as our work is to support the UN in this moment. As I said we will continue with the ministers welcoming President Santos in ten minutes from now, so I stop here and I will be back in the press room in a hour or so. Thank you.  Q&A Q. On Syria and the humanitarian initiative, you talked about it as being a test of Russia's willingness to be constructive. Is Russia the main reason why it has not happened? About the unity on Syria, frankly this is not the sense that we have. Were there any calls for sanctions on Russia over the Syrian conflict? No, we did not discuss at all sanctions and there was no Member State asking for additional work on sanctions. Second, you find the European Union's unity not only in my word but also in the statements I do on behalf of the European Union. You know very well, knowing from inside the “Brussels bubble” that whenever I do a statement on behalf of the European Union, that has been carefully drafted by all the 28 Member States and we did the last exercise of this kind just a couple of days ago. So, you find our unity every time we speak and more than that every time we act because I just finished at the end of last week the full round of talks with the regional players at ministerial level. I talked with all the ministers of the region, from Lebanon to Saudi Arabia, from Iran to Jordan or Turkey and in that action, in that diplomatic effort, you find the action of the European Union, and all its Member States united. All my contacts with the regional players, and Russia and the United States and the United Nations are happening on the basis of a mandate I clearly received from Foreign Ministers, Heads of States and Government in the European Council and happening on the basis of a common position we have determined on which we are working, on the basis of which we are working with our partners in the region. So, you find the unity of the Europeans and of the European Union not only in our statements but also in our diplomatic action and also in our humanitarian action. There is clearly a responsibility that lies first of all in the regime's hands that has the primary responsibility of making it possible for all Syrians to be reached with humanitarian aid. Indeed, there are places that have not been accessible to humanitarian aid on the ground, especially Eastern Aleppo, but I would like to stress that some two millions people in Syria have gained access to safe water, sanitation. And thanks to our support in Syria and the humanitarian aid the European Union has provided, some 850.000 people have received food, one million people in Syria have received essential items and shelter – still out of our humanitarian work – and 350.000 children have been covered by child protection programmes.  So this is just to give numbers of the humanitarian work the European Union has managed to do inside Syria together with our partners, being them international NGOs, UN agencies. You know that the humanitarian aid that the European Union provides is always channelled through actors that are working on the ground. But indeed, now the priority is the protection of civilians and in particular in Aleppo – not only Aleppo because it is not the only part of the country where the situation is very serious, I would say dramatic. But our work is constant, sometimes not very visible, that is why I believe it would bring some hope and some recognition also for the humanitarian actors if this could be reflected in the media as well, but we will continue because as I said in Rome some ten days ago, the European Union will never, never consider it as an option to abandon civilians. Our priority is to protect civilians everywhere and in particular in these days in Aleppo and in all Syria. Thank you.

Opening remarks by the High Representative / Vice President Federica Mogherini at the 23rd OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Hamburg,08.12.2016,08.12.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/16745_en,,"Security in Europe needs cooperation in Europe. This is why we are here, this is why the OSCE was founded. It is still true 41 years after the Helsinki Final Act. Check against delivery! Excellencies, Dear Friends, Security in Europe needs cooperation in Europe. This is why we are here, this is why the OSCE was founded. It is still true 41 years after the Helsinki Final Act. When our predecessors met in the 1970s, the situation was different, but not less difficult than it is today. Yet they succeeded in reaching agreement on the need for cooperation in our continent and across the Atlantic, and on a shared set of principles to drive such cooperation. Since then, the European security order has been based on the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States, the inviolability of borders, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the free choice of a State’s future. Today, these long-standing key principles of European security have not been respected. The crisis in and around Ukraine has yet to be resolved and the region continues to be burdened by protracted conflicts. Failure comes when we let our differences prevail, instead of focusing on our shared interests and on the international frameworks we need to achieve them. The European Union continues to see the OSCE as a crucial pillar of European security. It is a pillar built both on cooperation and on principles, because our common work needs to be underpinned by a shared understanding of the basic rules of our international system. We believe the OSCE can provide a tool and a framework towards peace and security in our continent. Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilising actions in eastern Ukraine are in flagrant violation of the OSCE principles and international law. The European Union will not recognise the annexation and will continue to call for it to be reversed. Likewise, we will continue to call for respect for the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and full implementation from all sides of the Minsk agreements. The European Union has given its full support to international efforts to bring about the full implementation of the Minsk agreements: these efforts include the ""Normandy"" format, the Trilateral Contact Group and the multi-faceted OSCE presence, in particular through the Special Monitoring Mission. The full implementation of the agreements can pave the way for a sustainable political solution to the conflict, in full respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. We stress the need for full, safe and unhindered access by the OSCE Monitoring Mission to the whole territory of Ukraine, including its border with Russia, as well as for the geographical expansion of the OSCE Observer Mission at the Russian checkpoints. The European Union is ready to increase its support for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, including our commitment to the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. We are also ready to sustain a possible OSCE mission to bolster the security of local elections and to contribute to reconstruction efforts. Elsewhere, we will continue our work to resolve protracted conflicts, based on the existing mediation formats. Our aim is to reach sustainable political solutions in line with OSCE principles and norms of international law. In light of the dangerous escalation in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict last April, the European Union calls for re-engagement in good faith on the basis of proposals put forward by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. We still hope to see the implementation of the agreements reached at the Vienna and St. Petersburg Summits. On the Transnistrian settlement, the European Union contributed to recent positive dynamics, leading to the 5+2 meeting in Berlin: we stand ready to support the sides with technical solutions to concrete problems between them. The OSCE's concept of security, with its three pillars, matches perfectly with the idea of “sustainable security” we embedded in our European Union Global Strategy for foreign and security policy. I would like to finish by saying that the OSCE has also a key role to play for us when it comes to migration, when it comes to addressing the crisis in the Middle East and in North Africa, and with a final word of appreciation and thanks for the German Chairmanship’s work: thank you Frank-Walter [Steinmeier, Foreign Minister of Germany], and I am sure we will continue this very good collaboration with the Austrian and Italian Chairmanships. Thank you. Hamburg"
Federica Mogherini's remarks at the panel on the future of Syria with the UN Special Envoy Staffan De Mistura,03.12.2016,03.12.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/16296_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the panel on the future of Syria with the UN Special Envoy Staffan De Mistura, Rome 2016 MED ""Beyond Turmoil, A Positive Agenda"" Check against delivery!    Moderator: Looking beyond the conflict is the space where you were putting a lot of effort, caught between two roles, one your work on the humanitarian side and two being engaged in diplomacy trying to reach out. Context is different now for the post conflict, with Russia and Iran feeling strengthened and maybe Riyadh feeling on the other side. Can you take us into your thinking on the next steps beyond the current situation? HRVP Mogherini: First of all, the European Union is not a military player on the ground. This is also maybe why this ticket, EU-UN, works so well. Because indeed, we might lack the military leverage, where the conflict is the hot one. But, for the European Union for sure, we are the humanitarian player, through UN agencies, through international NGOs, the European Union and Member States are the ones that are behind all aid delivered in Syria and around Syria – €9 billion invested so far in this. So whenever I am asked what are you doing on Aleppo, or on humanitarian, well, you should ask who else is doing? Because all the things that are moving in and around Syria on humanitarian level, are out of our work. So where are the others? That is my question. But, and we will continue, because it is our interest and it is also a must for us. While [US President-elect Donald] Trump might reflect on brutal realism, the European Union is based on principled pragmatism. We refer to that in our Global Strategy. There are differences, there might be also some points in common, but for us principles and also a certain degree of pragmatism is what guides us in the region as well. So humanitarian aid is the emergency, is the immediate and is a long-standing work that the European Union is doing and will continue to do. But with Staffan in this year, we have worked on the diplomatic and political track enormously. Let me say that I believe it is exactly the deal that we have done on the nuclear programme in Iran that has allowed that window of consensus in the Security Council for the first time since the war started and the ceasefire, the cessation of hostilities, in February. Because after the Iran deal in July, in September in the UN General Assembly, we managed to put together a framework, for the first time having all regional powers and international powers around the table to try to sort the political solution out.  Staffan has remembered how it worked in the beginning, how it is working less let’s say right now, also because of changes happening here and there, and mainly also across the Atlantic. In the European Union we believe that we cannot abandon the political track. And we cannot make the political track hostage of the military dynamics on the ground. Because so far we have always worked under the assumption that, first you have to have a cessation of hostilities that allows the humanitarian aid, and then you create the political conditions for having the political talks.  Maybe it is time to sound the ground with the regional powers and also with international players on what kind of future Syria could have, even in the moment when the fights still is going on in Aleppo and elsewhere. Many conflicts have found political solutions, negotiating political solutions, even during the fighting. So what we started, in agreement with Staffan and with Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, with the mandate of the Foreign Affairs Council, in the European Union, all the EU heads of State and Governments, I have started to reach out to all our regional friends, and the European Union is well positioned for that, because we talk to everybody, we are friends to everybody in the region. I have started visits in Teheran, in Riyadh, started talks with Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Emirates, Qatar, all the regional actors that, no matter what happens in Washington and Moscow, still live next door, will never, never afford forgetting it. Because Europe and the Middle East, we share the same sea, today it is quite self-evident, and those that live around Syria will have in any case to work on this proxy peace, and the reconstruction and the reconciliation, that is when the moment will come. So we have started this work. I am very much encouraged, because I see that there are common grounds, common lines that can emerge from these talks. We are not looking for ministerial formats, we are not looking for photo opportunities. We are doing it very discretely, bilaterally. But we started to reflect with all the neighbours and all the regional powers on three fundamental questions: what kind of future Syria is a Syria that all the regional powers can live with, the day after the conflict finishes? This to say, the future of Syria will have to be decided by the Syrians, but the regional powers have to allow the Syrians to use this space. So we need the regional powers not to decide on the future of Syria, but to agree on what is the, how do you say in English, the perimeter, within which a solution will be acceptable for them. What kind of form of government, what kind of role for the president of the parliament, what kind of decentralisation, what kind of system can allow all the different components of the Syrian government to be part of an ownership, the day after the conflict ends. Second, the reconciliation: How can we help the Syrians that sometimes look to me wiser than us. I met the other day the women advisory board that is helping the UN in this process. Let me tell you, they come from very different backgrounds, completely different political opinions. But among them, they find some common grounds. Maybe they can advise regional and international powers wisely on how we can find some basic common lines in the future. So how can we help and empower what is left of the civil society in Syria, to find bridges, to ways of living together, to heal the wounds of a long war? Because at the end of the day, in Italy we know that well: reconciliation after such a long war is needed. It is the most difficult part, having people living together, after having killed each other for so long. Third, what kind of reconstruction we can work on for Syria? Because in Moscow or in Washington someone could think: It is broken, not my problem. For Europeans, for the Arab world, for Turkey, for Iran, for Iraq, for you name it, we cannot allow having, we cannot afford having a black hole there. So in any case, we will have to work on reconstruction. But, Staffan is perfectly right on this, no reconstruction will start if it does not go hand in hand with reconciliation, with the power-sharing, with the political transition in Damascus that would unite the country, and allow all the regional powers and the European Union, which is not only a global power, but is also in this case a regional power, because we are part of the region. Only a political transition, only a political solution, only a reconciliation process, only a power-sharing mechanism will allow us to work on the reconstruction of the country.  And we want to do this together with our friends in the region, because we have started to see how much it will cost. None of us together, not even together, if not with an incredible mobilisation from the international community and all the resources that the European Union and others in the region can mobilise, will ever make it. Because we are talking about an amount of money that is beyond imagination. So we have a leverage there, I will be very pragmatic, we have a leverage there, we can use it. But we need this to go hand in hand with power-sharing and reconciliation. Moderator: If the EU is not in a position to call those terms, and this is the government that has been willing to allow its people be massacred and massacred its people and is working on a very different calculus, survival of the regime - this is a very brutal type of calculus that the EU might not be so good at playing at. What if the Assad regime stays in power indefinitely? HRVP Mogherini: You know, Staffan also was right when saying: Look at the conflicts we have had in the region already. And we have to also learn our lessons. You can win a war, but you can lose the peace. Does the regime, or the countries that are supporting currently the regime, do they really want to win a war on a zero-sum game approach? Is it convenient for them? Is it convenient even for the regime? How do you fix a country after six years of war? And Daesh, Al-Nusra presence in it, and a region that is not the most stable one, if I can use a euphemism.  Do you want a confrontational kind of approach, also when you try to move out of the conflict itself? Or do you want to find some ground for win-win solutions? Do you want to unite or do your want to fight, to run the peace still fighting? Running the peace still fighting is not a way of having a country, I am not saying having a functional country, even having a country. Look at how we are struggling with other situations in the region, or even far away from the region. So what I say is not based on principles, even if we have strong ones, and especially when it comes to Aleppo and the protection of civilians, I come back to that later. But even looking at interests: who has the interest of winning a war in Syria, and getting as a prize a country that is divided, armed, full of terrorists, surrounded by complicated countries, in some cases areas of conflicts, and isolated, if not wars, from international point of view? Is this convenient? Moderator: Coming back to the neighbourhood, the EU has paid particular attention in assistance programmes to Lebanon and Jordan, countries that are carrying huge amounts of refugees per capita, way above even Turkey’s numbers. Are you worried about a spillover? What is the EU doing in those countries, for the refugees in the long-term? They may not be able to go back, who knows for how long. What are your biggest worries in the wider region? HRVP Mogherini: What we are doing is, as i said before, we are the ones supporting, not only the humanitarian aid inside Syria - by the way with offices on the ground - the European Union as the UN has offices both in Damascus still, this is not so well known, but they are purely humanitarian offices that are operating still in Damascus and in Gaziantep for the north. So we are there on the ground, with our people, supporting UN agencies and international NGOs, in Syria, but mainly and also very strongly in the neighbouring countries. We are the ones financing the schools for the children, the Syrian children, be it in Lebanon, in Jordan, in Turkey. In Turkey i would l like to underline this, with a major problem of language that sometimes we don’t focus on enough because obviously the Syrian children in Lebanon or in Jordan don’t have the same language problem for going to school, but when it comes to Turkey, we risk to have a full generation of Syrian children who don’t learn Arabic or have a difficulty in education there. So that is why we are focussing so much on education programmes, including in Turkey, for Syrians, that are a people that are highly sophisticated and educated. I would stress what Staffan was saying, we should talk with them more and hear the level of knowledge and awareness of the challenges they will have in the future, and the willingness to go back and rebuild the country, the pride of being Syrians, no matter what kind of background. So what we are doing is this: support for the refugees, in the camps, in the local communities, and support to the local hosting communities, especially in Jordan and in Lebanon, because we have to avoid that the social tensions of those communities hosting the refugees explodes, creating more problems in Lebanon and Jordan, that are countries that in themselves are facing complicated times. So we are doing that kind of work, in the camps, outside of the camps, supporting the hosting communities, but also working with them on the political solution. Because they have, as well as other neighbouring countries, a knowledge, a familiarity with Syria, for good or for bad - the region has its own complicated story - but they can understand the dynamics in the country, better than we do - and we are still close - we are Mediterraneans, we understand the mentality, or that big international powers can, that can have the military power but not necessarily the soft power to interact with the Syrian players. So we are working with them to find ways to build this common ground. And again, you mentioned the Lebanon case. I find it extremely interesting that in this moment when Lebanon finally has a President, has hopefully finally also a new Government that can help the international community understand the shortcomings or the peculiarities of the Lebanon model. Personally I do not believe that the Lebanon model would work anywhere but in Lebanon. Lebanon is a miracle in itself, I think not repeatable, not possible to duplicate anywhere else. I think Syria will have to find its own model but for sure it be a model that cannot, as Staffan was saying, turn back time, simply because it wouldn’t work. And the challenge there is this - and is what we are discussing with our regional friends - what kind of system, what kind of practice can keep together the power sharing, the participation, not even only protection, but participation of all components of the Syrian society, to the running of the country, to the governance of the country. So not only a logic of a majority that rules the country protecting the minorities, but all of the different components taking an active stance in the reconstruction of the civil and political life of the country. And, the regional players, and the neighbours, creating the space that can allow them to do so. The space goes also with a little bit of encouragement, and some players have more leverage than others in this encouragement. But we have to put in the picture more the Syrians and the region, because so far, we have tried hard with the international card. It has worked for a certain time. Now I believe it is really the time for the region and the Syrians to come in a bit more prominently. Moderator: Turkey is such a critical partner for the EU in the post-conflict phase. Where is the relationship with Turkey vis-a-vis Syria? HRVP Mogherini : First let me say one thing on Aleppo. On a personal note, I am not that much at ease in the way in which we are now taking for granted that this is gone. I might be the only person in the room, but I don’t think it is correct from our side to say - as I have seen that we have been saying these days - that Aleppo is gone, is lost, and let’s think to the next step, be it Raqqa, be it how we manage the rest. I still feel that we have a political and a moral duty and responsibility. First, to protect the civilians: humanitarian corridors to let the civilians out of the city, at the same time as we try to bring the humanitarian aid in - food and medicines. Second, I still feel that we have a political and a humanitarian responsibility and duty to call for a stop of the strikes. It seems that we are simply forgetting that there is a reason for that. Sure, war is war. War is war and civilians need to be protected even in times of war. And we have international conventions for that. And from the European Union’s side, you will always hear the voice calling for a stop of the airstrikes on Aleppo and the protection of civilians. Moderator: But if we call and we don’t offer consequences when the call isn’t heard, how does that make the EU stronger? HRVP Mogherini : My main concern - I hope you can understand this: you can be cynical only up to a certain point - my concern is not the strength of Europe in this moment, my concern is the people in Aleppo. So that is my focus. I am sorry but I know, that was the reference to sanctions - I don’t believe that having sanctions tomorrow on one or two entities, which we are doing by the way - we have two hundred and thirty-something Syrians sanctioned at the moment and this has not prevented military escalations from happening. It is a possible way of pressure always, but it doesn’t have an immediate effect. It can have a symbolic, or a political effect or a long-term effect, or it can be a push to enter into negotiations with the perspective of lifting them if you enter into negotiations. But what you do tomorrow to save the people in Aleppo, still, I think we have to work hard every single day on this. And I believe this is not out of the picture of the work we are doing. This is not out of the picture of what the European Union is doing, I know this is not out of the picture of what the UN is doing. This is a priority. We cannot pass the message that Aleppo is lost, we turn the page, we move forward. No, we still need to save the people in Aleppo, to protect the civilians, to call for a stop of the airstrikes. And, again: no peace process will be easy on the ruins of Aleppo. No-one has an interest in destroying the city, killing other people, and then looking at what we do next. This will only make things worse. And by the way, I am convinced that the fall of Aleppo will not end the war; we will have other military escalations. So if a call to stop has to be made, it has to be made now, not tomorrow or in a week’s time. On [our relationship with] Turkey - I focus only on Syria. And this helps me also to say that the relations between the EU and Turkey are, Facebook would say “complicated”, but also very intense. You cannot have a complicated relationship if it is not a real, true,  intense relationship, and covers many different aspects. The media has been focussing mainly on the refugee issue. I always recall to our European friends, that the refugee crisis is not a crisis for Europe, it is a crisis for refugees first of all, and we have to be a bit calm on that - we can manage. And I know that [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] Filippo Grandi said important things here on this yesterday that I share. But our relationship with Turkey goes far beyond this: it is about Cyprus - and I would like to underline - in these days - very important -  it is about Syria, it’s about economic ties and so on, and  internal developments in Turkey, by the way, but this is for another panel. On Syria, Turkey is one of the countries in the region that we are starting this work on the post-conflict scenario and the reconstruction and the reconciliation. I see Turkey as evolving its Syria policy in these months. It is not for me to comment on that or to describe this evolution, but we clearly see this and we will have to see how this materialises in real terms. But I see that there is a space - I clearly see this - among the main regional players on some common ground for the future of Syria, which might also lead to a bit more of that, which might also lead to a bit of common ground for a security architecture in the region that might finally bring us fewer proxy wars - because we have many of them around - and a way of living together next to each other, because you don’t change geography at the end of the day. This is what Europeans have learned, after thousands of years of war, at a certain moment after the Second World War, we understood that it was much more convenient for us to live in peace and we started the economic cooperation. The European Union started like this, when we found out that it was more convenient for us to stop fighting each other and to start trading with each other. Maybe in the Middle East there is enough pragmatism to understand that it would be more convenient for all to trade instead of killing each other. Moderator: If there was one thing you would like to be done differently in the coming months, what would you like to see? HRVP Mogherini: I fully share Staffan’s ""wishes for Christmas” in the immediate, so I will focus on two in the mid-term and I hope not long-term. One is that we help the region - and the region goes from the Mediterranean to the Gulf, to the borders of Iran with Afghanistan - to find or invent a way of living next to each other. If not liking each other, at least accepting each other. Again, we have done this in Europe: Germany and France, Germany and Poland, Italy and Germany - we have managed to do that. I am 100 per cent sure that the region has in itself the strength and the wisdom to get to to this kind of security architecture for the region. And we can help, and would be delighted to help. Second - it’s a big wish - if we manage to take the religion out of this. Because this has nothing to do with religion. Shia and Sunni have been living together for centuries, in the same countries, in the same villages. This is spoiling the rest of the world: from Africa to Asia, to Europe, to the Middle East. If you want to make a conflict, make a conflict, but don’t cover it with a religious approach. I see this religious cover of a geo-political fight as the most dangerous poison that the region can spread in the rest of the world. So maybe I should turn this around. First, let’s try to have a detox exercise, and bring the religious aspects where they belong, which is a very serious place, and leave the geo-politics and the religious spheres distinct. ( Applause ) Having the Secretary General of the Arab League clapping on this is a very encouraging sight for me. Second, is the more positive, engage with each other - if you want, we can offer a space - in building, you can call it a Helsinki approach, engage in a way of building a system that allows neighbours to accept the fact that they are neighbours and they can live with each other without making war.

"Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič visits Moscow, announces hosting of gas trilateral in Brussels",25.11.2016,,http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4001_en.htm,http://europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_16_4001/IP_16_4001_EN.pdf,"This site uses cookies.

Today, European Commission Vice-President for Energy Union Maroš Šefčovič on a working visit in Moscow, Russia, has discussed topics related to energy policy. In meetings with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President Šefčovič has reiterated the readiness of the European Commission to continue discussing gas supplies for the ongoing winter in the trilateral format involving Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission. In this context, Vice-President Šefčovič said: "" I look forward to hosting gas talks with Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission. The next round of talks should happen in Brussels soon. In the past, this forum has proven its usefulness: it is better for all to sit down together around one table. Russia as an exporter, Ukraine as a transit country and the EU as the main importer share a common interest of predictability. The trilateral format remains the most suitable for discussing gas supplies for the upcoming winter heating season ."" On the significance of energy relations between the EU and Russia, Vice-President Šefčovič said: "" The European Union and the Russian Federation are interdependent in energy matters. The European Union is the key customer for Russia´s fossile fuel exports: We pay on time. We pay in hard currency. And we also want to buy Russian gas in the future "".  The European Union and the Russian Federation have had a long-standing relationship in energy - one of mutual interdependence, beneficial to both. Energy has been a key element in Europe's trade with Russia for many years and it will continue to play an important role in the future. Europe has been a major, stable market, and a reliable customer for Russia. As Russia's key customer, and a major energy consumer, the EU would wish to continue to see Russia as a reliable energy partner. Despite the number of issues relating to bilateral gas trade today, the EU also wishes to continue to see Russia as a reliable supplier of natural gas. In the same manner as producers are fully entitled to explore possibilities of developing new markets, consumers are fully entitled to seek competitive prices, and diversification of energy sources and routes. Stability and predictability are beneficial for both the EU and Russia. The EU has embarked on a major project of developing an Energy Union and is fully committed to its objectives, including energy security of all of EU members, as well as Ukraine and other countries.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,14.11.2016,14.11.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/14821_en,,"Check against delivery! Thank you. Thank you all for still being here. It has been a long day and tomorrow we start again with the Defence Ministers. Let me start with the decision we have just taken on Security and Defence. You might remember it was exactly one year ago today that France invoked for the first time in the European Union's history Article 42.7 of the [European] Treaties: solidarity after the attacks in Paris. And we all responded that day with solidarity, but also with a commitment we took one year ago to have a serious, deep work  to strengthen our common European Union Security and Defence. Exactly one year later, and only four months after I presented the Global Strategy to the European Council at the end of June, today, the Council, we all agreed on the European Union's plan on Security and Defence. And that is thanks to an excellent work that our teams have done both here in Brussels and in all the 28 Member States and I would like to pay tribute to their really incredible work. As I said, in these times we often hear about crises or divisions in the European Union. Today we decided all together, all 28 Member States, on a plan on the European Union's Security and Defence. Obviously the European way, so with all our tools together, not only the hard power, not only the military ones but also in an integrated approach with all our policies. This is what makes the European Union special: not a military alliance but a player that has in its toolbox also the soft power, the  civilian capacity and this is why it is so much needed in these times of tensions in the world that the European Union manages to work on Security and Defence in a more effective way. So it is a plan that is ambitious, concrete and pragmatic. I think you have seen it because we have released it a couple of hours ago. It is very substantial, very long as well, prepared in a record time with the full involvement of all Member States in these three months of work. It is moving from the shared vision we prepared with the Global Strategy at the end of June to common actions that we prepared in these last three months from September – actually we worked on that also during the summer break, not just from September onwards - with very concrete elements for this. I would use here the words that a Minister used in the room, mentioning the fact that this is a ""qualitative leap"" - “ un saut qualitatif "" - in the European Union's security and defence. Obviously we will start implementation as of tomorrow and I will go in detail on that. But before that let me say clearly that it is a plan for the European Union's Security and Defence, which is an integral part of a package that is much broader than that.  On one side it is an integral part of the full implementation work on the entire Global Strategy, whichinvolves other sectors, far beyond security and defence: from building resilience to the integrated approach to conflicts and crises or public diplomacy, and many others. We will talk about that in another occasion for sure, but this is an integral part of the entire work we are going to implement on our global role as the European Union. But this plan we adopted today is also an integral part of a broader defence and security package together with two other very important steps we are going to take in the coming weeks: one is the European Defence Action Plan that the Commission is preparing and that we will discuss together with the Defence Ministers tomorrow morning with [Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs ] Elżbieta Bieńkowska and that will be ready for adoption at the end of the month, which will look more at the incentives for capabilities and the industrial part of our work. And the third pillar of this defence package or security package of our European Union in these months is the implementation of the EU – NATO Joint Declaration we signed in Warsaw and on which I have been working and our staff have been working together with [NATO Secretary General] Jens Stoltenberg and NATO to prepare a set of concrete options for implementation, which we will present to our Councils options in December for approval; so a joint set of proposals for implementation. The three will constitute an integrated, coherent work to strengthen our work on security and defence, in full complementarity with NATO. I think we stressed it several times, let me stress it once more: strengthening the European Union's defence and security is also a way of strengthening NATO and vice-versa. So, going to content, because I understand very well that the Conclusions and the implementation plan itself are very long, so I can try to provide a sort of guiding reading to the long documents to facilitate it, and then, again, you will have time to go through to it and I will try to answer some questions. First the implementation plan we agreed today defines a joint level of ambition for the European Union, identifying three core tasks of the European Union: 1) responding to external conflicts and crisis; 2) working with partners in building their security and defence capacities; and 3) protecting the Union and its citizens. The Council then in the Conclusions tasks me to follow up with concrete actions to fulfil the new level of ambition on which we will start to work immediately and I will come back to that in a moment. Let me say clearly what the implementation plan is not about, and then I can focus on what it is about. It is not about a European army. I often say that even NATO does not have a NATOarmy. It is Member States, it's allies that put together one set of forces that every single Member State, every single ally has and can use either for NATO or for the European Union or for the UN or for other purposes. So it is not about a European army. It is not about creating a new European Union SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe)-style headquarters. It is not about doing the European Union territorial defence. For this NATO is there; for those that are Allies and others have their own national defence competences. And it is not – as I said – about competition and or duplication with NATO. So what is it about? Because the fact that it is not about all these things does not mean that it is not about anything. On the contrary, the substance of it is first of all about providing the European Union with the capabilities, the structures, the tools and the financial resources that are needed to fulfil the level of ambition we identified. So far work has been the result – as I said – of a broad consultation, a broad ownership of the Member States, and this will be needed also in the next steps that are key. Next steps include: developing the required defence capabilities for the future, according to the level of ambition we identified; deepening defence cooperation through the European Defence Agency and considering the setting up of a coordinated annual review on defence; improving the development of civilian capabilities, including on rapid response and training; improving structures for planning, conduct and situational awareness including by addressing, as a short-term objective, the gap we have on the operational planning and conduct of non-executive military missions, and I will come with proposals to take concrete steps to implement this very soon. This is not about big structures, as I said, not about big operation headquarters, but it is about streamlining and making our current headquarters work better and address the shortcomings. Every time that I am asked whether we want to establish an EU headquarters I remind my interlocutors that we already have five EU headquarters. So it is about having our structures work better. It also includes the way forward: strengthening rapid response and reinforcing the usability of the Battle Groups. Next year it will be ten years we have them; they were never used - maybe it is time to make use of the instruments we have. Enhancing our financial solidarity, flexibility and effectiveness when it comes to funding our activities in the field of security and defence; exploring the potential of an inclusive permanent structured cooperation with concrete commitments that Member States would be willing to make in strengthening the CSDP. Here I will provide elements and options for Member States then to decide how far or where they want to go. This has to be – the Permanent Structured Cooperation – a Member-States-driven process but I will be more than ready to offer for further thinking options of an instrument that was never used, so we don’t have precedents and we don’t have case studies to offer. So we will develop this in a matter of weeks. And developing, last but least, a more strategic approach to our work with partner countries that share our values and contribute to the CSDP, including also the possibility to enhance their resilience, also in the context of hybrid threats. Now on the way forward concretely in the coming days - and I say days because tomorrow as I said we have the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency and the Defence Ministers’ meeting in the Council, so we will start as of tomorrow swiftly taking forward the tasks that I received with the Council of today: 1) setting capability development priorities: the Conclusions we adopted today put a deadline for next spring, but the proposals will be ready in a matter of weeks; 2) coordinated annual review on defence by early next year; 3) permanent planning and conduct of CSDP missions and operations, again by early next year;4) explore the potential for permanent structured cooperation in a matter of weeks. Strategic orientations obviously will come also from the European Council in December where all this work will be presented and we will present further options - some of these that I mentioned now, maybe, already in the European Council. I will discuss obviously with President Tusk how we can move forward very fast together and then the first yearly report of the entire implementation of the Global Strategy by June next year. So as you see, it is about keeping the speed quite high and at the same time preparing the ground for mature proposals and mature decisions, because any decision that the European Union takes in the field of security and defence has to be based on careful thinking, careful preparation, a lot of our work from our staff. But as I said several times this is not the time for strategic thinking only, it is also the time for quick delivery and we know that our citizens expect the European Union to deliver on security. And this is one field where I believe that we will be – we are already today – in the conditions of delivering concrete actions together, as I said, at 28, commonly as the European Union. Let me share the satisfaction of having this immense work on security and defence done and endorsed at 28 in such a short time after the summer. The part on security and defence was done together by foreign and defence ministers. But we also had a full day of talks with the Foreign Ministers only today - we tackled mainly three issues: first we started with the situation in Turkey where we agreed to continue to have first of all a strong and united position at 28. The basis of this is the statement last week I did in the name of the 28 Member States expressing very serious concern on the developments there – and we see constantly news confirming our worries; clear messages, but also a very much open channels with the Turkish authorities, also with the Turkish opposition and with the civil society in Turkey. But the channels are open at all levels, including mine, obviously,to make sure that we communicate with each other. It does not necessarily mean that we understand each other all the time but it is very important that channels remain open between a candidate country and a partner and the European Union and its 28 Member States in an united manner. So today it was an occasion for the Ministers to exchange views in person. We were coordinating messages last week through either ambassadors or telephone calls, so this time it was the opportunity to exchange at length on the scenarios. There are no conclusions adopted. It was not foreseen because we just released the common position last week, but it was a useful exchange. We also had a point on our preparations for the next Eastern Partnership Summit, which will be held in Brussels in November next year. We have started preparations on that, and let me say that especially in these times it is very important for all of us, and for me personally, to signal the very high priority that we give to the Eastern Partnership as such and to our relations to each and every one of the six countries of the Eastern Partnership. If you want I can elaborate on either single proposals or single countries, we discussed also at length about that: reaffirming our determination to continue to invest in our partnership, continuing to support our partners and their reform agendas. Last but not least at all, we had an exchange on Syria and Libya - mainly on Syria. I updated the ministers on the regional outreach I have done following the last Foreign Affairs Council where we decided to start a work on post-conflict, on the future of Syria, not only in terms of economic reconstruction that could start only when a real political transition starts but also on the governance, the set-up and the end game of a political transition that we started, I started, already with Qatar, Iran and Saudi Arabia in the last weeks and I will continue this week with other interlocutors in the region and obviously with the Syrians. Obviously on Syria the work continues also to try and push the humanitarian assistance, especially in the besieged areas, in particular Aleppo, that is channelled as you know through the UN system, so we are working very much with the UN to try and move things forward there. It is not an easy exercise in these times. And we also exchanged briefly on Libya, on recent developments and we will come back to that for sure in one of the next meetings. I stop here and wait for your questions. Q&A Q. On the Battlegroups: what has to take place for you to use them and is there consensus on what kinds of scenarios the battlegroups would be used for? Are we talking about training missions or a broad array of crisis response? A. First, there is a consensus on the kind of scenario, yes. I normally make reference to the example of bridging towards a UN peacekeeping force, that take time to be built up, while Battlegroups are by definition a rapid response instrument we have. There are obstacles. Well, the main obstacle is always political will, but this time if we manage to agree at 28 consensually on an Implementation Plan on Security and Defence, as dense and substantial as the one you have in front of you, I believe we have enough political will to use the instruments we have. Because we finally realised that we manage to deal with European security and the security of our citizens only if we stand together and work together in this respect. The economy of scale, somehow, is required. But there is also a financial element that needs to be tackled and this is exactly one of the things we will be looking at in the coming weeks. Q: The meeting was probably also to talk about the outcome of the US Presidential elections. The President-elect has emphasised his sympathy for Russia's President Putin. So in this light, aren't you afraid that projects like Nord Stream 2 could be used more than ever by Russia to put through its energy exports political pressure on the Central and Eastern European Member States, and also Ukraine, since you emphasized the Eastern Partnership? A. On this in particular let me say that the Council stated very clearly, last time we had Conclusions on energy in the Foreign Affairs Council, that for us it is strategically important to maintain the role of Ukraine as a transit country. That is a clear, common position. The last time the Council expressed itself on this issue it was extremely clear and unequivocal. We didn't discuss today at the Council the recent US elections. We had, as you might have heard, an informal dinner yesterday night, where we took into consideration possible implications for the EU's security and foreign policy and our common line on steps to be taken immediately: first of all, continuation, obviously, of our work with the current administration, which stays in power until January 20 [2017]; but also to establish new contacts with the new administration and to start working with the next administration. So today that was not mentioned at all in any of our talks - I'd say, some of the issues we have discussed are obviously issues that we currently work with the US on, so especially Syria, Libya, but also on other issues, there has been a reference. But we discussed that yesterday night so it was not on the agenda today and it was not central to any of the discussions we had today. Q. Similar question, but in a slightly different way: obviously this document was put together before the US elections. What difference does Donald Trump election and his scepticism about NATO make to the way Europe defends itself? A. You rightly pointed out the fact that we started this process well before the US elections and we would obviously have discussed this document today whatever the results of the elections in the US would have been. This because it is now for some time that we realised at least at the European Union - I cannot speak for the Americans -  that there is an added value that the European Union can bring to security and defence of Europeans and European Union citizens. Something very pragmatic, but also ambitious. I would say that we tried it several times, because it was clear in waves in history that there was and there is a specific role for the European Union to play in security and defence. It was tried in the 50s, and then we know how the story ended. Actually the Lisbon Treaty foresees instruments that were then never utilised. Probably because the financial and the economic crises moved our attention from security to economy. And so some of the instruments the Treaties foresee were never used, were never explored. Basically all of the things I mentioned here today can be done within the existing Treaties and are foreseen by the existing Treaties, so we are not discussing about changing the Treaties or opening new Treaties. We are talking about instruments we have, we have had for some time, but we have never utilised, we have never looked into that. I see that today what changes is that there is a growing awareness in European public opinion and consequently in the European leadership in the Member States, in Brussels, that security is a matter also for the European Union. It is not by chance that I had made references to the attacks in Paris one year ago. We realised we have work to do there. Part of this work is obviously interior-related, but there are things we can do outside of our borders, with our external instruments to improve the security of our citizens and working with our partners. So we will do this and we will continue to do this in strong partnership with NATO. It is not for us to say what the future US administration will think or will do on its role in NATO. We are sure about our relations with NATO which is strong, has been strong and will continue to be strong. Actually, as I said we are even strengthening this: in a few weeks' time together with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg we will present to our Councils a set of proposals to strengthen our cooperation even further. We are working together more and more. He always says we have done more in terms of strengthening the EU-NATO partnership in this last year than in the previous seven-eight years all together, which is true. So we have clear ideas on where our European interests are and we continue on our way. I think this is the first time - but this is not new with these elections in the United States, it was also the case before - it is maybe the first time in decades that across the Atlantic a process that strengthens the European Union defence and security is not seen as competing with NATO, but as a way of strengthening NATO and the transatlantic alliance. And then obviously there is also the need of the Europeans to, again, take care of themselves. But we have clear priorities, we have clear policies, our investment is for strengthening the European Union's security and defence and to do it in complementarity and partnership with NATO. Q. You just mentioned the Eastern Partnership and the discussions you had today. We want to know more about the cooperation with Georgia from your perspective. Our Prime Minister is going to visit Brussels at the end of this month and we are still waiting for the final decision on visa-free. A. This was an issue that not only Ministers discussed, but that I raised to the Ministers in the very beginning – visa liberalisation both for Georgia and for Ukraine - with a clear sense around the table of the Foreign Ministers that this is a priority for the European Union to deliver on that, as Georgia has met the criteria and there is a determination to move forward on that. I am looking forward to the visit of the Prime Minister here. It was considered by all that the situation in Georgia is clearly extremely encouraging, extremely positive and that there is a need on the European Union's side to deliver on visa liberalisation.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the end of the informal dinner of the EU Foreign Ministers,14.11.2016,14.11.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/14697_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the end of the informal dinner of the EU Foreign Ministers Brussels, 13 November Check against delivery! Good evening. We had a very fruitful, good meeting with the Foreign Ministers and all the twenty eight Member States on the EU-US relations, not an extraordinary meeting, simply an informal dinner before we start tomorrow morning early with our own formal agenda. I can say there is unity among all the twenty eight on the need first of all, to continue working on the strength of the transatlantic relation. The European Union and the United States are partners and will continue to be partners for what concerns us in the European Union, based on our own values, principles, interests. Secondly, we discussed also the need to strengthen the European unity around some key issues that will be even more crucial in the months to come. First of all, the need to work on the multilateral system: for us it is extremely important to work on the climate change agreement implementation, on non-proliferation and the protection of the Iranian nuclear deal, but also on trade and all the crises we have around us on which, during these last eight years, we worked very well together with the United States; and we are looking forward to a very strong partnership with the next administration. We have decided together to engage with the incoming administration even from these very first weeks of transition. Obviously we will continue to work day and night with the current administration but also preparing the ground for the change in administration from January, and I will be glad to not only visit Washington soon but also invite the future Secretary of State to one of our next Foreign Affairs Council. As I said, unity, consensus around the table on the need to develop these two tracks: investing in the EU-US strong partnership, protecting and preserving it, but also strengthening the European policies and actions in an independent manner, based on our consolidated policies and positions. As you know very well, tomorrow with the Foreign and also Defence Ministers we will be deciding on security and defence from the European prospective, in cooperation with NATO – this is obviously one thing that was on the table before the US elections and has even more reasons to stay on our table today. Thank you. Q&A Q. On the absence of some Foreign Ministers including Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister of the UK. A. All 28 Member States were represented around the table, a couple of Ministers were not present, one or two could not make it for agenda reasons, for instance the French Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called me this morning to excuse his absence, he is receiving Antonio Guterres early tomorrow morning in Paris and obviously this is also a very important thing to do now from the European perspective: to guarantee that the EU-UN relationship, partnership, common work is even intensified so we agreed that it was much better for him to stay in Paris and meet the future Secretary General of the United Nations. A couple of Ministers were not coming for political reasons, one in particular, you know that well. But I can also share with you that some in Europe are surprised not when that country is absent, but nowadays that it is still present around the table of the 28. So, I guess it is only normal for a country that has decided to leave the European Union not to be so interested in our discussions on the future of our relations with the United States. Q. On possible worries regarding the changes that will probably come with the new administration. A. The key word here is “probably”. We have shared ideas, but we all agreed on the fact that we will need to see which are going to be the policies of the next administration. We see that they are still, let say, to be defined, obviously we will see what will be the foreign policy agenda of the next administration. For the moment it is not a “wait and see” attitude we can afford having because the world goes on, Europe goes on, crises go on but also opportunities we can take go on and so we need to continue working and it is not up to us but it is going to be up to the next US administration to define their own positions. We have clear in mind what our positions are, both in terms of EU’s interests and in terms of EU’s principles; among these interests is for sure the need to work with the Americans, but, again, it will be up to them to determine their own foreign policy agenda. Q. Do comments by Donald Trump on European defence give your defence agenda a push forward and what are your worries over Iran deal? A. On defence, you know that my proposals were put on the table in the summer already. I see the need for the Europeans to strengthen their defence and security agenda and cooperation, regardless of the changes in the administration in the United States. It is indeed very timely that we discuss these decisions and take these decisions already tomorrow, but again this would have been true with any kind of administration I believe. It could be, we will see what kind of determination the next administration will take on defence, more relevant in the future. In any case, this is something that is in our interest to do. And on Iran, let me tell you very clearly that this is not a bilateral agreement, it is a multilateral agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council resolution. So it is in our European interest, but also in the UN interest and duty to guarantee that the agreement is implemented in full. For the whole duration of the agreement, which is 10 years. I have personally a specific role to guarantee that this is done by all sides, and for sure this is in European interest. So we will take that as one of the keys elements that will not change. As I said, there are some key issues on which the European interest is very clear, common, there is no doubt about that: the climate change agreement is one of those, the implementation of the Iranian deal on nuclear and in general our non-proliferation work for our own security, it is very important, but also our common work on migration. We have just started in the UN framework in September at the General Assembly a Global Compact, to share responsibility globally, on managing the migratory and refugees flows. We, as Europeans, believe that we need to share responsibility around the world on this. This will be a clear basis for the EU’s engagement with all our partners. Obviously the United States are, for us, a key indispensable partner but again, we will not determine ourselves the agenda of the United States in the next administration. We will have to see what the next President will determine as his own foreign and security agenda. Our own agenda is clear. Thank you. Q. On the relations with Russia and on the proposal of Italy to have a “Schengen for defence”. A. On defence, we talk more tomorrow also because we will meet again tomorrow a couple of times. On Russia. You know, the European Union has a very principled position on the illegal annexation of Crimea and the situation in Ukraine. This is not going to change, regardless of possible shifts in others’ policies. But on the other side, we talk with Russia and we work with Russia on many different things, including for instance the Iran Deal where we worked wonderfully well together, or the Middle East Peace Process or Libya, counter-terrorism, to some extent on Syria where we have worked together in the International Support Group for Syria, even if our positions are very different on some issues but on some other coincide. So, I would invite you to avoid any black and white representations of our relationship with Russia. On one side, there is dialogue and engagement – what we call constructive but also selective engagement on some issues; on the other side there is a strong principled position especially on Ukraine and on the other conflicts that we have to our East; and our attention to our Eastern partners is going to stay and stay strong. We will talk about that with the Ministers tomorrow on our official agenda and this is not going to change in the European Union. Thank you, I will see you tomorrow. http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I129157  Abbiamo fatto una buona riunione con i Ministri degli esteri, tutti e 28 i paesi membri presenti su, non la crisi dei rapporti con gli Stati Uniti, tutt'altro: per condividere qual è in questo momento l'interesse dell'Europa. Ci siamo trovati tutti d'accordo come europei nell'indicare innanzitutto nell'interesse dell'Europa quello di avere rapporti stretti con gli Stati Uniti, anche con un cambio di amministrazione, dipenderà ovviamente dal prossimo Presidente degli Stati Uniti determinare la sua propria agenda di politica estera che ancora sembra essere in divenire, quindi non anticiperemo di certo le sue scelte. Non sta all'Europa determinare la politica estera degli Stati Uniti, aspetteremo quali saranno le indicazioni di un nuovo Presidente una volta che sarà insediato, ma certamente è nell'interesse dell'Unione europea stabilire, anzi, investire e continuare ad investire in un forte lavoro insieme a Washington, continuare su molti dossier, ma sulla base di interessi, principi, valori molto chiari, che sono i nostri valori, i nostri interessi europei, dall'accordo sul clima, al commercio, dalla realizzazione piena e completa dell'accordo con l'Iran sul nucleare, alla condivisione della responsabilità globale sui fenomeni migratori. Il nostro interesse è chiaramente quello di garantire che gli europei abbiano a Washington degli interlocutori con i quali lavorare, ma sulla base delle nostre priorità che sono molto chiare, aspetteremo di capire il prossimo Presidente come determinerà la propria agenda di priorità. Nel frattempo continuiamo a lavorare con l'amministrazione esistente, ma abbiamo anche deciso che inizieremo a lavorare con il transition team a Washington già da queste settimane, io sarò felice di invitare il prossimo Segretario di Stato americano ad una riunione dei Ministri degli esteri dell'Unione europea, appena sarà insediato. Partnership, continuare a lavorare insieme, ma sulla base di idee politiche molto chiare e sulla base degli interessi e dei valori europei. Q. Siete d'accordo su quale segnale inviare alla nuova amministrazione americana? A. Sì, quello di una forte amicizia, di una forte volontà di partenariato che continua, ma appunto sulla base di principi, valori e interessi europei molto chiari.  Q. C'è l'Europa della difesa che sembra uscita paradossalmente rafforzata da questo risultato elettorale negli Stati Uniti perché negli Stati Uniti si parla di disimpegno, d'inizio di un disimpegno. C'è questa volontà di rafforzare l'Europa della difesa, si è sentita questa sera? E in questa Europa della difesa, ci sarà comunque il Regno Unito anche se c'è la Brexit? A. Di questo parleremo domani ufficialmente. Come sapete domani pomeriggio presidierò un incontro con tutti i Ministri degli esteri e della difesa dell'Unione europea, compresa la Gran Bretagna, per adottare un piano per la difesa e la sicurezza dell'Unione europea. Quindi ne parleremo meglio domani , sicuramente questa è un'esigenza per l'Europa per i cittadini europei che non nasce dopo le elezioni americane. C'era anche prima, io ho avviato questo percorso ancora prima dell'estate, è chiaramente ancora più importante oggi che l'Europa riesca a fare la prima parte per la sicurezza dei propri cittadini in modo più efficace. Oltretutto oggi è un triste anniversario per la sicurezza europea, il dramma degli attentati a Parigi un anno fa. Proprio un anno fa, esattamente un anno fa, c'eravamo ripromessi come europei di lavorare per rafforzare il nostro lavoro comune sulla sicurezza dei nostri cittadini, una gran parte del nostro lavoro spetta chiaramente ai Ministri dell'interno, alle parti di politiche che possiamo adottare all'interno della nostra Unione, ma c'è un lavoro che possiamo fare all'esterno dei nostri confini, sia sul versante della difesa, che sul versante della sicurezza che è ora di fare, le proposte che metterò sul tavolo domani sono esattamente in questa direzione.

Joint statement by HRVP Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides,25.10.2016,25.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/13029_en,,"Joint statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides on the urgency for humanitarian aid to reach Aleppo At the end of the humanitarian pause declared by Russia in Aleppo, no agreement has been reached on the medical evacuation of wounded civilians and the delivery of aid, in spite of continuous efforts by the EU, UN and all humanitarian actors on the ground. There are thousands of people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. On 21 October, the European Council invited us to continue pursuing the emergency humanitarian initiative. We therefore reiterate the urgency to allow humanitarian deliveries in parallel with the evacuation of the injured civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law. This must be done while ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian and health care personnel during aid delivery and medical evacuation. We call on the Syrian authorities and their allies to renew the humanitarian pause in Aleppo and to issue the facilitation letters to allow the inter-agency convoy as planned in the UN October aid delivery plan. All parties must demonstrate unequivocally a genuine commitment to allow humanitarian aid operations to address the urgent needs of Syrian civilians and to provide safe and unhindered access to humanitarian organisations across the country. All Syrians in dire need, whoever they are, have the basic right to receive lifesaving assistance. All parties to the conflict should stop the shelling of civilian areas and medical structures in Aleppo city. Deliberate attacks against civilians, including humanitarian and health care personnel, and against civilian and medical infrastructure, are clear violations of international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes. There is no military solution to the Syrian civil war. Bruxelles"
"HRC - 25th Special Session - EU Statement on ""the deteriorating situation of Human Rights in the Syrian Arab Republic and the recent situation in Aleppo""",21.10.2016,21.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/12630_en,,"HRC - 25th Special Session Geneva, 21 October 2016 EU Statement on ""the deteriorating situation of Human Rights in the Syrian Arab Republic and the recent situation in Aleppo"" Mr President, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Candidate Countries Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [1] , Montenegro*, and Albania*, as well as Ukraine align themselves with this statement. Mr. President, The EU is appalled by the deteriorating situation in Syria. The escalating violence in Aleppo is causing untold and unacceptable suffering for thousands of its inhabitants. Since the beginning of the offensive by the regime and its allies, notably Russia, the intensity and scale of the aerial bombardment of eastern Aleppo is clearly disproportionate and the deliberate targeting of hospitals, medical personnel, schools and essential infrastructure, as well as the use of barrel bombs, cluster bombs, and chemical weapons, constitute a catastrophic escalation of the conflict and have caused further widespread civilian casualties, including amongst women and children and may amount to war crimes. The Syrian regime has the primary responsibility for the protection of the Syrian population. The EU condemns the continued systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights and all violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, particularly the Syrian regime and its allies. The targeting of a UN humanitarian convoy on 19 September is a clear violation of international law, which requires full investigation. The EU looks forward to the findings of the internal UN board of inquiry. Those responsible for such violations and abuses must be held accountable. A renewed cessation enabling efforts to find a political solution in line with the provisions of UN SCRs 2254, 2268 and the Geneva Communique of 30 June 2012 cannot wait further, in order to allow all parties to reengage in negotiations for a genuine political transition. Women's full and meaningful participation in this and other political processes must be ensured. The EU calls upon all parties, especially the Syrian regime, to provide full and unhindered countrywide access to all those in need and to end all obstruction to the delivery of humanitarian aid. The use of starvation of civilians through the besiegement of populated areas for which the regime bears the greatest responsibility, as a tactic of war, and forced population transfers are a clear breach of international humanitarian law and must stop. Providing immediate relief to the suffering is imperative. All those responsible for such breaches of international law, in particular of international humanitarian law and human rights law, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, must be brought to justice, including those committing crimes against religious, ethnic and other groups and minorities. Impunity for such crimes is unacceptable and thus the EU will continue to support efforts to gather evidence in view of future legal action. The EU recalls its conviction that the situation in Syria should be referred to the ICC and renews its call to the UN Security Council to take action in this respect. The EU and its Member States will seek to explore possibilities of concerted action inter alia through the UN General Assembly. In this regard we welcome the work of the CoI and support the request for a comprehensive, independent special inquiry into the events in Aleppo. Thank you Mr. President  [1] The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.  Geneva"

The European Council today will have an agenda very much focused on our external work. First of all, I will brief the Heads of State and Government on the state of play of our work on migration - on the external work we are doing on migration; the first results on the Migration Compact but also the ideas on the External Action Plan with Africa; and also the work we are doing on migration on the external side of our work in migration with other countries like Afghanistan and others. I will then also introduce the debate on Russia this evening. I believe that the approach I prepared with the Foreign Ministers and that I will present, based on a balance between firmness and dialogue, will be the one that will keep us all together. Continued unity is what we need in the European Union. Finally, I will update the Heads of State and Government on the situation in Syria: the work the European Union is doing in these hours to try and bring humanitarian aid to eastern Aleppo, but also with the regional key players and the work we started on the future of Syria. And tomorrow we will have a very important point on trade with a discussion on our trade policy and in particular on CETA, the agreement with Canada, a very important part not only of our economic policy but also our foreign policy.  Q. Would sanctions on Russia help to stop the bombing of Aleppo?  A: As President [of the European Council] Tusk also said, the issue of sanctions on Russia related to Syria is not an issue for discussion and for decision today – as it was not the case with the Foreign Ministers three days ago in Luxembourg. Obviously, all options are always open, but today the work of the European Union is focusing first on the urgency of bringing humanitarian aid to Aleppo, saving lives and making sure that the diplomatic channel maintains the ceasefire as long as we manage to reach the wounded, the people who are dying on the ground, and create the political space for a solution of the crisis – it is a diplomatic work we are focusing on at this moment.  Q. What do you hope to hear from Theresa May [Prime Minister of the United Kingdom] today? A: Let’s see.  Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I128121    Bruxelles"

This also means addressing international challenges together, including the implementation pf the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. "" Johannes Hahn , Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations said: ""Environmental protection and climate action is not only our duty, it is a good investment that will result in new jobs, higher revenues, and a more resilient economy. Thanks to EU support, SMEs across the Eastern Partnership region are being made aware of green economy opportunities and are starting to utilise them. The EU will continue to support Eastern Partnership countries in their efforts to build a resource and energy-efficient economy, to the benefit of all our citizens. "" Ministers for environment and climate change from EU Member States and Eastern Partner countries discussed opportunities for cooperation on environmental governance and the green economy . They stressed the need to shift towards the sustainable and integrated management of natural resources and sustainable consumption and production in line with circular economy principles. They highlighted the opportunities that environmental protection offers to the private sector and industry to stimulate economic growth. During the afternoon session on Climate Action, Ministers will look at how to bring forward the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change . Discussions focused on the question of how Eastern Partner countries can develop low-emission and climate-resilient economies, including by exploiting the great potential for energy savings in the region. The ministers agreed to meet in two years to assess progress on cooperation between the EU and Eastern Partner countries. In the meantime, they tasked the Eastern Partnership Panel on Environment and Climate Change to draft and implement an action plan translating into practice the provisions of the Declaration. Background The Ministerial meeting on Environment and Climate Change is co-organised by the European Commission and the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The European Commission is represented by Commissioner Karmenu Vella , responsible for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and Commissioner Johannes Hahn , responsible for European Neighbourhood Policy. The EU and Eastern Partner countries are represented by the ministers, state secretaries and senior officials for environment and climate change. The main body to steer the Ministerial process and follow up on the commitments of the Declaration will be the existing Eastern Partnership Panel on Environment and Climate Change . The Panel brings together the European Commission, EU member states and Eastern Partner country experts, as well as civil society organisations to discuss the progress on environment and climate change, share best practices and facilitate cooperation and coordination on regional programmes. The Eastern Partnership is a framework ofcooperation between the EU, including its Member States and the six countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood. Support in the field of environment and climate change for Eastern Partner countries is of strategic importance for the EU to achieve objectives inside the EU and to improve the quality of life of the citizens in partner countries. The EU is committed to supporting the shift to better environmental governance, low-emission development and a greener economy in the Eastern Partner countries. The EU funded regional projects such as Shared Environmental Information Systems East , Greening Economies in Eastern Neighbourhood and Clima East : Supporting Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Eastern Neighbourhood countries and Russia are supporting these efforts.

14th Cooperation Committee between the European Union and the Kyrgyz Republic addresses reforms and development cooperation,18.10.2016,18.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/12366_en,,"14th Cooperation Committee between the European Union and the Kyrgyz Republic addresses reforms and development cooperation The European Union and the Kyrgyz Republic held their fourteenth Cooperation Committee meeting on 18 October 2016 in Brussels. The Cooperation Committee reaffirmed the commitment of both parties to strengthen cooperation in a number of areas. Both parties addressed recent political developments in the Kyrgyz Republic and reviewed the progress made in a number of key governance reforms, including electoral reform, judicial reform and the rule of law, which the European Union supports through its Development and Cooperation Instrument. Developments in the region and security challenges, including radicalisation, were discussed. The European Union emphasised the key role of civil society in preventing radicalisation and reinforcing internal stability, both of which can only be maintained through government policies based on the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Union stressed the importance for the Kyrgyz Republic to uphold cooperation with key international organisations whose respective expertise significantly contributes to advancing the reforms in line with international best practice. The European Union confirmed its commitment to support the democracy and sustainable economic development in Kyrgyzstan. The Cooperation Committee provided an opportunity to review the implementation of bilateral development programmes in key sectors such as the rule of law, education and rural development, to which €184 million has been allocated for 2014-2020. Both parties agreed to create a Sub-Committee on Development Cooperation, which will allow for a thorough review of our development cooperation priorities and programmes. The Cooperation Committee followed the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Trade and Investment on 17 October 2016, during which significant discussion was devoted to measures to help Kyrgyz exporters benefit from the preferences granted unilaterally by the EU to the Kyrgyz Republic under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP+), in January 2016. Kyrgyz authorities presented measures to enhance a business environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship and foreign investment. Alongside bilateral and trade relations, regional economic integration was also discussed. The meeting was chaired by Mr Luc Devigne, Director for Russia, Eastern Partnership, Central Asia, Regional Cooperation and OSCE countries in the European External Action Service, as the head of the EU delegation. The delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic was led Mr Nicolai Chuikov, the National Coordinator for Cooperation with the European Union. Bruxelles"
Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,17.10.2016,17.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/12253_en,,"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council Check against delivery!  Thank you.  Starting with Syria, I can say that after a very long  conversation we had with all the ministers but also – at least for parts of the discussions - with Staffan de Mistura [UN Special Envoy for Syria], we have a united, clear, strong, common EU position and message on Syria. First of all, the priority is to stop the bombing of Aleppo and in this respect we call on the Syrian regime and Russia to stop the bombing and to avoid further humanitarian catastrophe. You will see the entire conclusions. The language is pretty clear and that constitutes our common, strong basis for not only stating our position but also action. When we say that the European Union firmly believes there is no military solution to this conflict, this means that the European Union supports and encourages all efforts in all formats to stop not only the bombing on Aleppo, but also supports all efforts to avoid any further military escalation, any further confrontation at a military level and also supports all efforts in all formats to agree, implement and monitor an effective ceasefire. In this respect obviously we commended the meetings that were held during the weekend, hoping that this will bring results in the coming days. The EU agrees - and this is our common basis - to call for an end of all military flights over Aleppo, immediate cessation of hostilities to be monitored by a strong and transparent mechanism; sieges to be lifted and country's wide humanitarian access to be guaranteed. Because our priority in this moment is to save Aleppo and to save human lives. This is why the European Union will continue an intense, diplomatic humanitarian effort reaching out to all players on the ground and internationally on a humanitarian initiative that we launched a couple of weeks ago that, in coordination and cooperation with UN agencies, would deliver humanitarian relief to Eastern Aleppo and other besieged areas and allow the safe monitor evacuation of urgent medical cases. And we urge the Syrian regime to give authorisation for humanitarian convoys to be delivered, in particular and starting from Eastern Aleppo. This is an issue that I have discussed in these last days repeatedly with [Sergey] Lavrov [Russian Foreign Minister], [Mohammad Javad] Zarif [Foreign Minister of Islamic Republic of Iran] and with other players and we really have the one priority today which is saving Aleppo and saving human lives in Aleppo. But the EU is also ready to play its part on the political track and as we say that there is no military solution to the conflict, we are ready to start working to help, in this context, in constant and full coordination with the UN and [the UN] Special Envoy [Staffan de Mistura] . This is why we decided to launch a dialogue with key regional partners, with key actors in the region, to start looking at where a political transition might end up; what the regional players and the European Union can do to start preparing for the post-conflict period in all its different strands, be it reconciliation, reconstruction, institutional structures of a post-conflict state, that we all agree, has to be united, not divided, secular, inclusive and with space for all minority groups. We might also look at ways together with regional key players of working on local governance and devolution but also national and local reconciliation. And as I said, start looking at economic reconstruction that could begin obviously only once the political transition starts, but can be prepared or that we can start preparing already now. We believe that this work can be useful first of all to provide, to explore some common ground among different actors, but second also to reinforce or strengthen other parallel tracks that are focusing more on the immediate urgency, especially the ceasefire and the military process. So no duplication at all; no substitute at all but a way to serve in a better, more pro-active way from the European Union side the current efforts, the current processes that are in place on one side, linked to the role of the UN Special Envoy who discussed these proposals with us today but also by the ISSG [ International Syria Support Group ] co-chairs that are restarting efforts in this direction, in this moment. Let me conclude the point on Syria by saying that we also obviously discussed the need to continue fighting against Da’esh and other UN designated terrorist groups both in Syria and Iraq. Let me use this opportunity to say that the news of today is the offensive on Mosul that has started this morning, a crucial element for the in the campaign to defeat Da’esh. We will discuss this tomorrow also with the Iraqi Foreign Minister [Ibrahim Abdul-Kareem Al-Jaafari] who will be tomorrow with me in Brussels. The Iraqi authorities and the Iraqi people have our full support in this difficult time and we will need to work on prioritising protection of civilian population of Mosul and the full respect of international humanitarian law. Syria was not the only issue we discussed. We also tackled the migration work we are doing. As you might know that this week - actually tomorrow - the European Commission will adopt the report on the Migration Partnership Frameworks - the Migration Compacts - that will be presented at the European Council later this week. I took the opportunity to share with the ministers elements of this report that show a positive trend with all five priority countries. All ministers welcomed not only the work done but also the progress already achieved in these first months. Obviously these are first steps. We will need to continue the work and let me share with you that I thanked all the ministers and all the Member States because if we have now a positive trend on the implementation of the Migration Compacts, it is thanks to the active teamwork that all Member States have played together with the European institutions with the five priority countries. We also decided early this morning to proceed with the implementation of the Global Strategy in all its different strands, moving from a shared vision to common action. So the work will continue. In November I will present to the foreign and defence ministers in a joint session of the Council the implementation plan on defence and security. That will lay the ground of the Council of December to adopt steps to be taken to strengthen the European defence. But let me underline the work we are doing in the implementation of the Strategy is not limited to Security and Defence. We will carry on our work in other fields, in particular building resilience of our partners in our region and beyond. Africa is a key example of this. And talking about resilience, we also decided to - in a busy day we take time to focus also on the positive stories – to increase our support to Tunisia, a country that looks to Europe and the European Union with a lot of hope and sympathy. We feel very clearly and very strongly the fact that it is for the European Union to provide the support, those accompanying measures that Tunisia needs to make the difference especially towards its youth. This is why we decided to allocate up to €300 million for next year – 2017 – for Tunisia, especially to create the soci- economic conditions for the Tunisian youth to find the own way in life, in their country, in security and to prevent all possible dangers that the country can face in a regional challenging time, especially given the risk of tensions spilling over from Libya. I will stop here and I will leave space for your questions.  Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I12758 9  Q and A: Q. Russia has announced an 8 hour ceasefire on Thursday ahead of the European Council. Is that a serious step in the right direction? Will it allow the EU to have a single one of the convoys through to Eastern Aleppo? And on your initiative on the political track, could that include any discussions involving the Assad regime? A : On this last point let me be very clear: no. We do not have and I do not have contacts with [Bashar] Assad [President of Syria] personally, or with the regime. So the aim is to talk in particular with the key regional parties like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, but this does not exclude others, and also to continue the work we have carried on in these last months with key Syrian players – the HNC [The High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian Opposition], the main opposition, but also civil society organisations starting from women, churches, Christian minorities. The work we can do and the work we have started to do is trying to see if is possible locally to build bottom-up some space for confidence and reconciliation. I know this can sound extremely out of sync in the moment when the fights are so hard, and it is, but many different conflicts have showed us over history that you have to start somewhere. With the difficulties we are facing in guaranteeing, ensuring a sustained ceasefire, we think that there is space for starting reflections on what can be the future of Syria if there is common ground in the region and among different parties on what could this future look like. This future we believe could first of all, prepare the ground for the moment hopefully - Inshallah , they would say in the region - the time comes but also possibly to create some confidence among the actors to engage seriously in talks. As I said, this is not and please do not entitle this as"" a new European initiative"". We are launching talks to work on the post-conflict, so this does not substitute or duplicate existing tracks. On the contrary this is in support of existing efforts that we believe are key and essential. In the meantime, we can use our knowledge, our skills, our contacts, our experiences to start reflecting on the day after which is where the Europeans have most of their experience, being born as the European Union itself in a post-conflict situation. So it is aimed at facilitating if possible, preparing the ground and preparing some common ideas and some concrete work. On the announcement made by Russia on the eight hours, you know, it can be a start. There are discussions ongoing if the eight hours are enough for the convoys to deliver the aid in East Aleppo or not. This is an assessment that is not for us to make, but for the humanitarian agencies on the ground to make. It is very serious and very complicated work that needs to be assessed in all different and small details. For sure it is a positive step, but again the last assessment we had from the UN agencies was that twelve hours were needed, so I believe that there will be a little bit of work needed to find the common ground also there. But as I said, anything that could alleviate the humanitarian suffering, the catastrophe that we are seeing in Aleppo would be urgent and needed. I reiterate the call first of all on the Russian authorities and on the Syrian regime to allow humanitarian aid in East Aleppo but also stop the bombing, because again the world cannot look at what is happening in Aleppo without taking action in this respect. Q. [In Italian] Lei da questa mattina ci aveva annunciato che non ci sarebbe stata una discussione sulle sanzioni alla Russia, così è stato, quindi qual è la richiesta che in sede politica e diplomatica arriva da parte dell'Unione europea nei confronti della Russia sulla Siria? A : Innanzitutto la richiesta dell'Unione europea alla Russia e al regime siriano è di fermare i bombardamenti su Aleppo, garantire un cessate il fuoco che possa essere realmente effettivo e oggetto di monitoraggio dal punto di vista internazionale e garantire in questo modo che gli aiuti umanitari abbiano accesso ad Aleppo, alla parte est di Aleppo. L'Unione europea ha presentato un piano di emergenza di sostegno umanitario insieme alle agenzie delle Nazioni Unite. Quindi siamo pronti a entrare con i convogli delle agenzie umanitarie ad Aleppo Est nel momento in cui ci sarà una pausa, nel momento in cui ci sarà uno stop ai bombardamenti e tutte le necessarie autorizzazioni, perché abbiamo visto quello che è successo ai convogli anche delle Nazioni Unite poche settimane fa. E crediamo che sia indispensabile che la Russia e il regime di Damasco garantiscano queste misure perché il mondo non può assistere al dramma di Aleppo senza porsi la priorità assoluta di questo momento che è salvare vite umane. Q. On your initiative which is talking about the future [of Syria]: High Representative, you know more than us that everybody in this region is trying to shape the future of Syria, a future that everybody sees from a different point of view. Which mechanisms practically you are going to use? What are you going to ask them exactly? Second point: could you clarify please the EU position concerning Mr de Mistura initiative about on Eastern Aleppo because noting this initiative it traces some questions. Supporting him but noting his initiative to support Aleppo, why? A : Well, first of all, on this second part of the question, we have discussed this quite in detail during our conversation. What the European Union clearly says is that whatever can work on the humanitarian side for Aleppo we would welcome and support; whatever would prove to work on the ground. Because we know that also the initiative that Staffan de Mistura has presented has some difficult parts to be implemented, but if it works we will be more than ready to support it. Obviously our proposal to have medical assistance in the city and medical evacuation from the city also has the element that it requires the stop of the bombing, at least for sufficient time, and I would say for continued time. Once it is not enough to be substantial. We both agreed – him and us altogether – whatever we can do together in Aleppo to save lives, to improve lives in Aleppo, to rescue the city we will support. So there are no divisions on that. The priority is to have a humanitarian initiative that can work and can be supported by both of us. The other question: I will not elaborate now on mechanisms also because I don't imagine particular mechanisms. I do not even call it an initiative, we launched talks with regional partners and key actors in the region but also we will talk with Syrians as I said because it is sometimes a bit of paradox that the future of Syria is discussed without the Syrians so this is what we are doing with the opposition groups, the civil society, with the Syrians who still live in Syria. To see if there is a common ground to start with; I believe that there are some elements on which we can explore far away from the media news if there is some common ground. For sure there is common ground on the need to preserve the unity of the country which is not something to be given for granted if we continue this way. There is common ground on the need to have a secular country, there is common ground on the need to guarantee that all minorities in Syria find their place in the future of Syria. How does this translate into mechanisms? How does this translate into governance? How does this translate into institutional partners? This is something that the European Union can maybe facilitate - a thinking to develop the common ground, to develop, in principle, concrete solutions. As I said, the process can start in Geneva hopefully once the UN Special Envoy decides to reconvene them, but in the meantime we can do some preparatory work to prepare some common work. And please don’t underestimate the work we can do on the reconstruction of the country because this will have to happen anyway and this is as we have seen in many conflicts, this is not something easy or irrelevant. So the work on reconstruction will be key and the work on reconstruction is linked to governance and institutions that will be put in place. This will be connected with the work that the US and Russia are starting to revive and the work of the UN Special Envoy de Mistura.  Q. Merci de nous dire quelques mots sur le travaux de ce matin sur la République Démocratique du Congo. A : Nous avons adopté des conclusions du Conseil sur la République Démocratique du Congo. Il y a – on sait bien – un dialogue qui est facilité par l’Union africaine. Il est essentiel pour l’Union européenne d’encourager tout le monde à fixer une date pour la tenue des élections. Nous pensons qu'il est encore possible d’avoir les élections en 2017 et aussi à encourager tout le monde à être clair sur le fait que la Constitution soit respectée et notamment sur la limite du mandat du président [Joseph]Kabila. Nous avons aussi décidé de regarder tous les instruments que nous avons pour aider à l’arrêt de la violence et pour encourager  un climat politique qui soit plus constructif que celui-ci que nous avons maintenant. C’est la décision que nous avons prise, il y a des conclusions qui sont publiques déjà et c'était une décision consensuelle importante, je pense. Ce n'était pas seulement une décision que nous avons prise mais aussi un point que nous avons débattu pendant le Conseil. Merci.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the discussion on Syria at the Foreign Affairs Council,17.10.2016,17.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/12240_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the discussion on Syria at the Foreign Affairs Council Check against delivery! I will give you just a quick update and then I will meet you in an hour or so. This is to say that we have a common, united position asking first of all Russia to stop the bombing and create the conditions for a cessation of hostilities, most of all for humanitarian aid to reach Aleppo. We have had a very good discussion with the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura. We have decided that the European Union and the UN will work more together to push the humanitarian aid into Aleppo, but also that the European Union will start talks with key actors in the region on the post-conflict phase in Syria. I know this seems far away now but we believe - and we have shared with the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura - it could be helpful in this moment to start reflecting on the post-conflict institutional settings for Syria: reconstruction, reconciliation, governance, including local governance. The European Union will start these talks in the coming days - not as an alternative but as a complementary track that could help and facilitate the other efforts that are ongoing in Lausanne, under the UN auspices, to try and create a political space for some common ground on the future of the country. But priority number one now is to save Aleppo, to save the people of Aleppo and this is why our strong call is on Russia and on the Syrian regime to stop the bombing on Aleppo and to continue talks with the US and other key players on the ground to avoid the catastrophe - first of all the humanitarian catastrophe in the city. And as I said, the European Union will start as of tomorrow talks, in particular with Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia. We will continue our work with different groups of Syrian opposition players – including the civil society, women, Christian minorities and others to start thinking of the day after the conflict because we have, and we believe we have, some positive leverage, some positive agenda that could be built. I know this sounds unreal in this moment, as we see the pick of violence in the country – but maybe thinking of what can be there in the future can also help the actors to find some common ground on which to engage also in the current talks. So you will see the Council conclusions. They are very clear and the unity around them is full. So the news is the European Union is clear, united, with strong positions but also with some concrete steps we have decided to take in the coming days. Q. Any idea when these discussions can begin? Is there a realistic timetable for this political track to start? You know we started testing the ground already last week with the calls and dialogues we have had with all the different key regional players, so we will continue in that respect. I don’t want here to raise expectations. It is simply something that we feel we have the responsibility to do. As I said not substituting any tracks; on the contrary, to reinforce the existing paths that we support very much and to see if the added-valued of the European Union that has always been institution-building, governance, reconciliation, and also economic reconstruction linked to a political transition can be of any help to create the space in the region and possibly in Syria to find some common ground. Again, in parallel to that we have decided to work on the urgent issue of Aleppo and the humanitarian track. Because this is the priority number one now: save lives. The European Union has put forward a proposal to bring medical aid in, to bring the wounded out. For that we need the bombing  to stop for some hours but again it is not only a matter of hours, it is a matter of responsibility. We all call on Russia to exercise its responsibilities also as an ISSG (International Syria Support Group) co-chair and show that there is the possibility of having a cessation of hostilities in place and stopping the bombing in Aleppo. This is urgency. The humanitarian plan is urgency. In parallel, what cannot wait for this to happen, is the start of the talks on the political future of Syria. Thanks. I'll meet you a while. Link to the video: https://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I127861 Luxembourg"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council,17.10.2016,17.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/12120_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council  Check against delivery !  Good morning. Today with the Ministers the main issue on which we will work is obviously Syria. I will propose to the Ministers some ideas on why and how the European Union can support more and better the work on the future of Syria. We will do this together with [UN Special Envoy] Staffan de Mistura whom I have invited to join us for a part of our work, because the European Union's role is in full support of the UN's work. We will focus in particular on the work the European Union is proposing for the humanitarian side, especially on Aleppo where the situation is dramatic, but also on the political future of Syria. You know very well, and you have seen the developments over the weekend, the European Union is not a military player on the ground in Syria - I have to add personally, I am proud of not being one - but we encourage and we support all initiatives that lead or can lead to a cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire, a solution among those who have a direct influence on the ground with those who are fighting. We are extremely engaged in fighting against Da'esh – and this is also why we believe that the work on the political future of Syria will be helpful also in the fight against Da'esh. We have also seen today some news coming from Iraq – and by the way I will have the Foreign Minister of Iraq [Ibrahim al-Jaafari] tomorrow in Brussels and we will discuss about that as well. So this will be the main topic for today - how the European Union can work more on the future, political future of Syria and on the humanitarian side. We will also discuss migration: I will report to the Ministers the first results of our work with the Migration Compacts, within the Partnership Frameworks, in preparation for the European Council on Thursday and Friday – also the point on Syria will prepare the European Council for sure. Then we will also have a point on the implementation of the Global Strategy with concrete implementation plans I will present to the Ministers and we will have a short but positive point on Tunisia, because we always have to keep the focus on what goes relatively well also in our neighbourhood and this is why we will work on our support to a country that is doing pretty well and obviously still needs all of our support.  Q: On Syria: will sanctions against Russia be discussed? A. This has not been proposed by any Member State. I have seen this has been very much in the media but not in our meetings. In none of our meeting this issue was raised by any of the Member States. But we have sanctions on the Syrian regime, as you know and there are discussions on that, for sure; that could be possible. Q: What do you personally think on sanctions against Russia? A . You know, I personally tend to focus on the fact that the European Union does not only have sanctions in its toolbox. We have many other instruments we can use, we have the instruments for pressure, we also have leverages for good. And so a good mix of the two, I think, is always wise and useful. So today we will focus on all tracks, but again, on sanctions on Russia, that was not proposed by any Member State at the moment. Q : Any signal from Russia or from Iran over the weekend that they are willing to compromise in Syria or from Russia that they are willing to stop the bombings on Aleppo? A . You know, we have discussed issues related to the cessation of hostilities now for quite some time, months, and it is extremely important that those that have a military presence or a direct influence on those that are fighting on the ground engage among themselves, seriously, to find a way. On the political will of the different partners around the table it is not for me to judge, it is for results to judge. We will see if the political will is there once the results will come. To me, and I think to all Europeans, what is important is that we avoid any escalation that could lead to more dramatic scenarios. I think Secretary Kerry said it yesterday in London as well. We have always to be mindful to the fact that an escalation in Syria might lead us to different kinds of scenarios that go, could go easily out of control. So it is very important for me personally but I think also for all Europeans - and it is a direct interest for all Europeans, that first the fight against Da'esh is kept high on the agenda and second, that those who have a military presence or influence on the ground find a way, first of talking to each other, second of finding solutions. If people talk, normally it is because there is political will to find solutions. But we will see from results. Thank you. Q. Aspettative sul dossier Syria nella riunione di oggi? A. Oggi proporrò ai Ministri di concentrarci su quello che l'Unione europea può fare sul futuro politico della Siria. Non siamo un attore militare sul terreno in Siria, giustamente dico io, ma siamo una forza regionale e globale che può iniziare a lavorare con gli attori della Regione, con differenti parti dell''opposizione, ma anche della società civile siriana per iniziare a discutere di quale sarà la Siria del dopo conflitto. Questo potrà anche aiutare a trovare una soluzione al conflitto, credo. Poi chiaramente proporrò a loro un'iniziativa umanitaria innanzitutto per Aleppo. Lo faremo insieme all'Inviato speciale delle Nazioni Unite Staffan de Mistura, perché il sostegno che l'Unione europea da alle Nazioni Unite è il modo per cercare di salvare vite umane ad Aleppo, non soltanto ad Aleppo e in tutta la Siria. Q. Il tema delle sanzioni di cui si parla a proposito di quattro Stati che le avrebbero in qualche modo determinate, qual è la sua valutazione? A. Il tema delle sanzioni oggi non è sul tavolo, non quelle sulla Russia rispetto alla Siria, nessuno Stato membro le ha proposte e non credo che sarà al centro del nostro lavoro oggi. Abbiamo delle sanzioni sul regime siriano che manteniamo e che sono sotto costante revisione. Ci potrà essere una modifica nel senso di un inasprimento di queste sanzioni nel corso delle nostre discussioni di questi giorni. Q.L'agenda è molto ricca, riuscirete a parlare anche di flussi migratori e quindi di problemi legati al migration compact e d'intervento nei paesi di partenza e transito dei flussi? A. Sì, oggi presenterò ai ministri una prima relazione sui primi risultati del migration compact . Avremo una discussione con i Ministri, soprattutto con quelli, come il Ministro Paolo Gentiloni e altri, che si sono recati nei Paesi di origine e di transito a nome dell'Unione europea. Questo nostro discorso avrà una funzione di preparazione anche del Consiglio europeo di giovedì e venerdì a Bruxelles, dove appunto relazionerò sullo stato di avanzamento del migration compact . E' fondamentale che su questo l'Unione europea si muova unita con tutti gli Stati membri pienamente partecipi di uno sforzo che non è di un singolo paese, ma dev'essere di tutta l'Unione europea.

Thank you very much Margot [Wallström, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden]. I will make it very short. Just to say that I am very pleased, not only to be here in Stockholm but also of our daily common work.  You said it yourself: Sweden is not only an active and loyal member of the European Union, but one of the most active ones. Let me start by saying that not only working with you personally, with the Prime Minister [Stefan Löfven], with the Defence Minister [Peter Hultqvist], with all the colleagues is a pleasure, it will also be a pleasure and a very important common work as Sweden will take its seat in the UN Security Council next January. You have a clear multilateral approach and you have shown this very clearly in helping us shaping the European Union’s Global Strategy.  Our discussions today were focused on the implementation of the Global Strategy that we have just started, together with all the Member States, and this is one of the reasons why I am making my visit here today to discuss not only with the government but also with the Parliament and with the Foreign and Security Policy Community here in Sweden about how to move on the implementation of our new foreign and security policy in the European Union.  We also discussed at length, as you said, the situation in Syria, preparing our next Foreign Affairs Council on Monday and obviously the European Council just a few days afterwards.  I also had the chance of discussing with the Prime Minister the state of play of implementation of our policies on migration, the external part of it, the Migration Compacts - which are in their implementation phase and maybe I will stop here and allow for questions. I am sure they will cover, help us cover the main issues we discussed.  Q . On the state of play of the migration agreement with Turkey.  A. As far as we see it, it is working. I was myself in Ankara in the beginning of September, to discuss not only this but also all a wide range of issues we have with Turkey. Our relations with Turkey do not limit themselves to the issue of refugees and migrants. We also discussed plenty of other things, including the situation in Syria and the Cyprus settlement issue.  But as far as the agreement is concerned, for the moment it is holding, it is working. For us it is essential, and I would like to stress it here - as I stress it also always when I am in Ankara - that this is implemented in full respect of international laws, human rights’ rules and standards of the European Union, of the international organisations. This is for us essential, and this is why we are working to implement this agreement, together with the UN agencies, especially the UNHCR and others.  Q. On the suspended talks between the US and Russia – what can the EU do - and on Aleppo and the humanitarian crisis there.  A. Let me start with the last one first. Because of the situation in Aleppo – and not only in Aleppo, all over Syria - after a conflict that has gone on for far too long, any conflict is even one day far too long but in this case we are really looking at a dramatic situation there,  the European Union has put forward a proposal, an urgency proposal on the humanitarian side of the situation. We worked in this last week with UN agencies and international NGOs to bring medical aid inside East Aleppo and allow medical evacuation of the wounded in East Aleppo. I have talked about this not only with the UN Secretary General, also with another half-compatriot we share, Staffan de Mistura, UN Special Envoy, but also have talked about that with Sergey Lavrov and with Javad Zarif, the Foreign Ministers of Russia and Iran, to see if, on the ground, we can allow at least some humanitarian relief in Aleppo.  Obviously the European position is very clear, we would need a cessation of hostilities, we would need an unhindered humanitarian access all over Syria. We never accept humanitarian access to be conditioned to political or military evaluations but with the images and the stories we hear from Aleppo first and foremost we have to act to bring humanitarian assistance in. So I still hope that, even in the current stalemate from the political and the military point of views, some common ground in the international community to allow some humanitarian relief in Aleppo and around Aleppo will be possible.  The words of Jan Eliasson [Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations], well you have a very wise compatriot, probably he was foreseeing already that the Security Council would have faced some difficulties as it has indeed experienced over the weekend in finding a common ground. To me, it has been very sad to see the Security Council in such a stalemate and especially Russia using its veto on a resolution that was backed by so many members of the UN. It is indeed extremely important that we preserve the political space for dialogue and diplomacy.  The European Union has been from the very beginning last year very supportive of the creation of the International Support Group for Syria, exactly because when we say that there is only a political solution to the crisis in Syria we mean it. And if you mean that there is only a political solution, you have to create the political space for talks. This requires good will, from all sides, and there are plenty of question marks about that in these days. But that also requires patience, I would say even  stubbornness and the European Union has  proved to be resilient in this respect. We are working to prepare, as you remembered, the Foreign Affairs Council when I will discuss with the Foreign Ministers some options that the European Union is studying, I will not anticipate that today, to try to facilitate that political space to be preserved.  Because the worse political thing that can happen now is that the political space for a political solution closes definitively and the voice is only the one of the arms. This is something we cannot allow. I believe that this is the same approach that the EU and for sure the United Nations share, and the EU is ready to do its part on the diplomatic and political and channel as well, as I said, on the humanitarian one that is, in these hours, the most urgent one.  Q . On Turkey visa liberalisation and on a possible similar deal with Libya.  A . No, Libya is in a completely different situation than Turkey. In Libya we have a security situation that is far from normal and the work we are doing with Libya in this moment is, first of all, to try and support the institutions building, the state building I would say, in a country that is still very much divided. We are trying to support with all different means Prime Minister al-Sarraj and also the unity of the country around the institutions that can be recognised by all the Libyans – this is the priority number one. On the number of migrants and refugees who are already in Libya, we are working with the IOM and the UNHCR to make sure that living conditions and human rights are properly respected which indeed is a matter of deep concern for us. As you know, we have a military operation in the Mediterranean Sea, Operation Sophia, that is working as dismantling the networks of smugglers of migrants but also saving people at sea. So, no similar deal with Libya for sure.  When it comes to the visa liberalisation, the European Commission has determined a certain number of criteria, benchmarks. It has always been a merit-based process, as it is always for every country that negotiates visa liberalisation regime with the European Union. It is up to the Turkish authorities to see if, when and how they would be ready to work to implement or meet these benchmarks. The benchmarks are there and are not going to change so now we are in this process of discussion with the Turkish authorities. Obviously the situation is not operating in a vacuum in the sense that Turkey has faced a deep shock in the middle of July with the attempted coup, so obviously also on their side things require more time and more reflexion when it comes to, especially, the need to change the anti-terrorism law. But again, the process is ongoing, talks are constructive for the moment, but the criteria will not be changed so the European citizens can be assured, and the Member States in the Council also, that criteria will not be modified and we have to make sure that they are all met before we go towards visa liberalisation. But you have a former Commissioner who also knows a lot!  Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I127412   Bruxelles"
Statement by the Spokesperson on the 10 year anniversary of the death of Anna Politkovskaya,07.10.2016,07.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/11422_en,,"Statement by the Spokesperson on the 10 year anniversary of the death of Anna Politkovskaya Today we pay tribute to a woman who had the courage to say what others may not have dared, and to stand up to injustice. Anna Politkovskaya was a staunch defender of human rights, a champion of words, and a patron of truth. Her death was and still is a tragic loss to freedom of speech in Russia and Russian journalism; her words will long be admired. The European Union will always stand up for and support freedom of expression, in Russia and around the world. As we have consistently said over the past decade, those who ordered this murder must be brought to justice. Bruxelles"

EU-New Zealand relations,05.10.2016,05.10.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/11173_en,http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/new_zealand/documents/political_economic_relations/eu_nz_joint_declaration2009progress_en.pdf,"The European Union and New Zealand are like-minded partners, sharing the same view and approach on many global issues. Both support democracy, the rule of law and human rights and are active players in multilateral organisations such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They also have shared interests in tackling key global challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, and preserving the environment, but also humanitarian aid and the fight against terrorism. The first political statement of cooperation between the European Union and New Zealand dates back to 1999, with signing of the Joint Declaration on Relations between the European Union and New Zealand. This was replaced in 2007 by the Joint Declaration on Relations and Cooperation , an updated political declaration. The Declaration set out a detailed action programme for the European Union and New Zealand in areas such as global and regional security, counter-terrorism and human rights, development and economic cooperation, trade, climate change as well as science and technology. The Joint Declaration also underlined the importance of closer co-operation to further facilitate people-to-people links and to encourage exchanges in higher education: Joint Declaration . On 5 October 2016, the EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand, Murray McCully, signed the Partnership Agreement on Relations and Cooperation [1] (PARC). The PARC will provide a comprehensive and modern legal foundation for EU-New Zealand relations. It will facilitate more effective bilateral engagement on the part of the EU and its Member States with New Zealand, by strengthening political dialogue and improving cooperation on economic and trade matters and in a wide range of other areas, from innovation, education and culture, to migration, counter terrorism, the fight against organised crime and cybercrime and judicial cooperation. Formal diplomatic representation of the European Union in New Zealand can be traced back to 1984 when the European Union's Delegation in Canberra was accredited to New Zealand. Following an invitation by the New Zealand Government, the EU opened an office in Wellington in May 2004. In September 2016, the first resident EU Ambassador to New Zealand took office , marking the transition to a fully-fledged and autonomous European Union Delegation. In November 2015, the EU Delegation opened a satellite facility - Europe House - in the heart of Auckland, New Zealand's financial and business centre. This first-of-its-kind initiative is the product of a unique partnership with Auckland University of Technology (AUT). It provides state of the art conference and event facilities to the European Union Member States' embassies, as well as to cultural and business associations. In September 2016, Europe Lane was inaugurated in Wellington's central business district. This was the result of a decision by the City of Wellington to name a lane after Europe, symbolically highlighting the ever closer ties between the European Union and New Zealand. An Administrative Agreement was agreed in 2012, establishing a diplomatic exchange of personnel program enabling a better understanding of each other's policies and facilitation of collaboration in key strategic areas.  Foreign and Security Policy and Development Policy Cooperation The European Union and New Zealand cooperate closely on foreign and security issues and engage in a regular political/security dialogue , including frequent consultations at ministerial and senior officials' levels. A Framework Participation Agreement (FPA) was signed in April 2012 , enabling New Zealand to take part in EU crisis management operations. Following the signature, New Zealand contributed to EUNAVFOR Atalanta (to combat piracy in the Horn of Africa). In the past, New Zealand participated in EUFOR Althea in Bosna i Herzegovina. From 2007 until end of 2012, it contributed significantly to EUPOL mission in Afghanistan. On major global issues the European Union and New Zealand are fully aligned and there is close cooperation, notably on Ukraine, Russia, Syria and the Middle East Peace Process, as well as on African affairs at the UN level. The European Union and New Zealand are also like-minded partners on international human rights issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, and they are both strong supporters of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The EU and New Zealand are working closely together with the aim of promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region . For example, the EU has cooperated closely with New Zealand in the Multinational Observers Group, during the general elections in Fiji in 2014, and continues to be engaged in jointly promoting the consolidation of democracy in Fiji. Both the EU and New Zealand have a shared interest in maintaining strong relationships with the countries of the Pacific. The EU has a trilateral dialogue on Pacific issues in place, together with Australia and New Zealand. Additionally New Zealand and the EU cooperate in the Pacific Islands Forum, with the EU being a Post-Forum Dialogue Partner. Regionally , both New Zealand and the EU are engaged in South East Asia through ASEAN, ARF and ASEM  Development Cooperation The European Union is the largest development aid donor in the world and an active player in the neighbourhood of New Zealand, being the second largest donor in the Pacific region . In March 2013, EU and New Zealand co-hosted the Pacific Energy Summit in Auckland, where a total of €410 million was pledged for energy projects in the Pacific Island countries.  There, they pledged to step up cooperation on sustainable energy, working together via the EU-New Zealand Pacific Energy Partnership , with other regional partners and in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Energy for All initiative. To this end, the EU and New Zealand signed a Declaration of Cooperation undertaking to maximise the number of energy projects implemented in parallel. On 7 June 2016, the EU and New Zealand co-hosted the 2016 Pacific Energy Conference in Auckland, which saw another NZ$ 1 billion pledged for development projects in the Pacific, including contributions from private sector. At the Conference, the EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Mimica and NZ Foreign Minister McCully, signed a Joint Declaration of Cooperation on a Pacific Partnership for Sustainable Development . It signals EU and New Zealand's commitment to expand the scope of their close cooperation on renewable energy to benefit, among others, Tonga, Niue and Northern Pacific, countries not previously covered. Furthermore, the Joint Declaration paved the way for the future expansion of the partnership to other fields such as climate change and sustainable agriculture, starting with Vanuatu.  Trade and economic cooperation The European Union and New Zealand have a mature bilateral trade and investment relationship as well as a shared commitment to a multilateral trade regime. In 2015, the EU was ranked as New Zealand's third largest trading partner in goods (after Australia and China). New Zealand was ranked as the EU's 50th largest partner. In 2015, total trade in goods between the EU and New Zealand amounted to €8.1 billion. New Zealand's exports (€3.5 billion) to the EU are largely dominated by agricultural products, while EU's exports (€4.6 billion) to New Zealand are focused on manufactured goods. The total trade in services between the EU and New Zealand amounted to €3.5 billion (EU exports of €2.2 billion, and EU imports of €1.3 billion) in 2014. The EU is the second largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in New Zealand and represents about 1/5 of total FDI in New Zealand. In 2014, the EU's FDI stock in New Zealand stood at €7.2 billion while and New Zealand FDI stock in the EU stood at €3.3 billion. In October 2015, European Union Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced with Prime Minister Key the start of the process towards launching negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The European Commission is carrying out an impact assessment and engaged with New Zealand to better define the scope and ambition level of a potential future FTA (the so-called ""scoping exercise""). Customs cooperation will be further strengthened by the new Customs Cooperation and Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreement to be signed and concluded in the coming months.  Sectorial cooperation There are a number of policy areas where the EU and New Zealand work towards joint goals. These include inter alia education, fisheries and maritime affairs, transport, sustainable energy, or cultural cooperation. The European Union and New Zealand have also negotiated a number of sectoral agreements designed to facilitate access to each other’s markets and reduce exporters’ costs. Notable examples include agreements on sanitary measures in live animals and animal products, horizontal air transport services , and on mutual recognition of conformity assessment . Senior officials' consultations on trade , agriculture , fisheries and maritime affairs and science & technology take place every year alternating between Brussels and Wellington. Consultations and information exchanges also take place in areas such as development assistance , humanitarian aid , and on climate change the EU and NZ cooperate well internationally and share experience of domestic policy issues. The European Union and New Zealand cooperate in a wide variety of multilateral bodies dealing with fisheries and ocean governance, where both New Zealand and the European Union are members. Both countries are also working together towards strengthening environmental and ocean governance, necessary to achieve the conservation and the sustainable use of resources, with a particular view to biodiversity, oceans and water issues. The European Union and New Zealand build up a strong relationship in research, science and technology guided by the Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement entered into force in January 2009. The two parties decided to define a more strategic vision of their Research and Innovation collaboration and already started to explore future partnership in domains of excellence such as precision agriculture and big data. 2016 has seen four universities in New Zealand as partners in successful research and innovation staff exchanges. The New Zealand European Union Centres Network (EUCN) was established in 2006. It is a network of seven universities in New Zealand that aims to combine the three elements of research, teaching and outreach under a unique thematic umbrella focused on the impact, role and understanding of the European Union within New Zealand and the wider Pacific region. Starting from 2004 the Jean Monnet Activities co-fund an academic Centre of Excellence hosted by the University of Canterbury . Currently, and until 2018, the Centre for Excellence (EXCELLNZ) will extend cooperation to all eight universities in New Zealand giving greater visibility to EU studies. The key themes are: encouraging engagement of civil society with the EU; nurturing early career researchers on European Union studies; and teaching the EU outside Europe. EXCELLNZ will promote civil society engagement with the EU and European issues.  [1] The official version of the text will be published in the Official Journal of the EU Bruxelles"
WTO Review:  EU calls on Russia to abandon import substitution measures,28.09.2016,28.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10713_en,,"On 28 and 30 September the World Trade Organization (WTO) holds its 1st Trade Policy Review (TPR) of the Russian Federation since it joined the WTO in August 2012. This is the first opportunity to comprehensively assess Russia's trade and trade related policies against the commitments it undertook when entering the WTO. Today, the EU presented its assessment of the situation. Russia's accession had raised high expectations, not only in Russia but also in the EU and among most other WTO members given its economic and political potential. Consequently, the EU did not hide its disappointment today when it recalled that instead of using the full benefit of its membership to open up and diversify its economy, Russia had quickly opted for an inward looking strategy based on import substitution. This has concretely translated into the subsidization of many sectors of economic activity including the automotive sector, into local content requirements for producers in many areas and into restrictions for foreign operators in public procurement. A number of poorly justified and disproportionate sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions have also been introduced. These policies, which were reported on in detail by the WTO Secretariat, have not brought more trade or growth to Russia. Neither have they increase product quality or lowered prices to Russian consumers. Far from it, they have introduced an economic and trade environment distant from the principles and spirit underpinning the WTO and global economic cooperation. The EU also expressed its strong criticism of a number of other measures taken by Russia including unilateral restrictions introduced in 2016 on road and railway transit from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and later also to Kyrgyzstan. Compliance of these measures with WTO rules and principles is also questionable and EU operators and cargo are also affected. The EU also highlighted problems with the overall business environment as operators are currently facing an uninterrupted flood of often non-transparent, complex and ever changing legislation, frequently implemented within extremely short deadlines and without proper public consultation conducted sufficiently in advance. Russia has been involved in a high number of formal disputes in the WTO since its accession. Today, Russia is in recession due to a mix of factors such as low oil prices, devaluation of the rouble and inflation. Russia's trade policy and in particular its import substitution policy has not helped in tackling these challenges. Russia's trade with its most important partners, such as the EU, US, Japan or China, has fallen dramatically since 2012, in some cases by more than 30%. While this is an effect of lower oil prices it is also directly the result of measures adopted early after WTO accession aiming at hindering foreign operators' access to the Russian market, via restrictions on imports, public purchases or investments in so called strategic sectors. According to the EU's assessment, Russia's influence in world trade and on the global economy brought with it increased responsibilities towards the WTO and its members.  The EU therefore called on Russia to change its track record regarding the implementation of its WTO commitments and to focus on restructuring and liberalizing its economy. Background Russia is the 4th most important trade partner for the EU. For some EU Member States, Russia is in fact the first trading partner outside the EU.  In 2015, total mutual trade reached EUR 210 billion representing 6% of the total EU trade excluding intra EU trade. The share of the Russian Federation on EU exports and imports was 4% and 8% respectively, in 2015. In terms of foreign direct investments the EU is still the most important partner for Russia in terms of EU stocks accumulated in the country. More information: EU Statement at the 1st Trade Policy Review of the Russian Federation - 28 September 2016: https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/world-trade-organization-wto/10696/eu-statement-at-the-1st-trade-policy-review-of-the-russian-federation---28-september-2016_en  Moscow"
Key Delegation Activities: Update,27.09.2016,27.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/11274_en,,"TALKING POINTS FOR DR MICHAEL PULCH TRADE We launched our annual Trade and Investment Publication on June 15. Not many people know that the EU is Singapore's first trading partner when taking Goods and Services combined. The EU is also the largest investor in Singapore – by far – accounting for almost $1 in every $4 that is invested here. In 2015, EU-SG trade in goods increased by 7.7% while the latest figures show that bilateral trade in services grew by 15.4 %. In addition, bilateral investment stocks experienced an increase of 15% year-on-year. This latest performances enabled the EU to confirm its role as Singapore's most important trade partner and the city-state's foremost investor. The EU and Singapore completed the negotiations for a comprehensive free trade agreement (EUSFTA) on October 2014. Furthermore, the EU and Singapore are also negotiating an Aviation Agreement, which will strengthen even further the economic partnership and will guarantee fair and transparent market conditions. Just last week, a Delegation of 5 MEPs from the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament came to Singapore to meet representatives of European Companies and the Singapore Government to discuss about the FTA ratification and trade issues. Also in June 2016, we launched the EU Business Avenues, which aims at promoting European SMEs in Southeast Asia by using Singapore as a hub for further business collaborations with other ASEAN nations, over the next 5 years, targets bringing 1,000 European SMEs in 7 different sectors to Singapore and 5 additional ASEAN markets. The idea is to look at new opportunities and forge lasting partnerships in Singapore and the region. We are collaborating with many partners and different stakeholders to promote this initiative.   Our aim is to facilitate technology transfers, know-how and enhance cooperation between European companies and local players in Singapore and in South East Asia. After the success of the first Business Mission in July 2016, the second Business Mission on Green Energy Technologies is coming to Singapore and Malaysia in October 2016. European Companies will have the opportunity to showcase their innovative technologies and to meet Asian potential partners during the Energy Summit in Singapore and a standalone event in Malaysia. In March next year, the focus will be on Contemporary European Design. AVIATION This summer, the European Commission has been authorized to start negotiations for an EU-ASEAN aviation agreement . This is an important step in boosting connectivity with Southeast Asia, while boosting the European economy. Almost 11 million passengers annually travel between Europe and Southeast Asia, and this is expected to rise by 5% every year . An EU-ASEAN aviation agreement would generate economic benefits of 7.9 billion euros, as well as 5700 new jobs by 2023. The agreement will offer new opportunities for the Asian and European sectors, new air routes and better fares, as well as a level playing field. Removing barriers in this area will carry economic benefits, foster regulatory cooperation, and improve inter-regional relations overall. DEFENCE, SECURITY & POLITICAL ISSUES EU’s Security Role in the Region The EU has been following closely the developments in the region, especially in the South China Sea. The EU has strong interests in the region, be it from the trade point (80 % of world trade going through South China Sea) or from its role as a global actor promoting the rule of law. The EU has also made a statement on 15 July following the UNCLOS’ Arbitral Tribunal Award (the EU is a contracting party to UNCLOS) acknowledging the Award and recalled its commitment to maintain a legal order of the seas and oceans based upon the principles of international law, UNCLOS, and to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The EU does not take a position on sovereignty aspects relating to claims. It expresses the need for the parties to the dispute to resolve it through peaceful means, to clarify their claims and pursue them in respect and in accordance with international law, including the work in the framework of UNCLOS. On this regard, the EU published a statement in March 2016 on the South China Sea calling on all claimants to resolve disputes peacefully and again following the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Referring to EAS , the EU requested to be invited as a guest of the Chair at the next EAS in Manila in 2017. Singapore seemed more positive towards this idea, building on the precedent for Russia in 2005 and EU’s increasing role in ASEAN, including on air liberalisation. EU-ASEAN Relations EU-ASEAN relations are growing steadily and moving to a next stage. There is a commitment on both sides to work towards realising a strategic partnership. The next important event is the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting on 13-14 October in Bangkok where the HRVP will be present. Human Rights Two upcoming EU events: a seminar on 14 October at NUS in the context of the international day against death penalty  and the annual conference in the context of the Human Rights Day, which will take place on 9 December at the Raffles Hotel EU Global Strategy EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini released over the summer EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy, which was welcomed by all EU Heads of States and government. The EU Global Strategy sets out the EU's core interests and principles for engaging in the world. It explains what the EU stands for and hopes to achieve in the world. It identifies clear priorities in terms of actions to be taken; and it looks at the full spectrum of foreign and security policy instruments at our disposal. The strategy will help us to be more effective in tackling challenges such as energy security, migration, climate change, terrorism and hybrid warfare. None of the EU’s Member State has the strength nor the resources to address the threats and seize the opportunities of our time alone. The EU Global Strategy will guide the EU in its daily work towards a Union that truly meets its citizens’ needs, hopes and aspirations. Participation in the Shangri-La Dialogue In 2015 the High Representative Federica Mogherini attended the regional security summit. This year, our managing director for the Asia-Pacific Gunnar Wiegand attended along with Chair of the EU Military Committee General Kostarakos. Gunnar Wiegand attended a number of bilateral sessions with key stakeholders: Vietnam, Singapore, Philippines, and India. With Singapore potential areas for cooperation were addressed such as Cyber-Security. Any other political issues The threat of terrorism affects all of us. In Singapore the discussion often centers around the question of 'if, not when'. Following recent attacks in Paris, Jakarta and Brussels there is potential for us all to work towards greater coordination of counter-terrorism response and counter-narrative to tackle extremism. Singapore has done exemplary work on counter-radicalisation and is an ideal partner in this regard. The EU continues to take an interest in Human Rights and will be working with the Singaporean government to organise an event for the Annual Human Rights Day in December this year so watch this space for more information. CLIMATE CHANGE EU welcomes that Singapore had ratified the Paris Agreement, along with 29 other countries, at the UN General Assembly on 21 September. EU very much involved in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) negotiations on the Global Market Based Measure which should deliver carbon neutral growth for international aviation as of 2020 would be taking place from 27 September to 7 October in Montreal. Different sources indicated that Singapore would back the agreement. The EU chief negotiator will be in Singapore in October. Building on the previous events on Climate Change organised by the EU and MS in Singapore, a specific event on aviation could take place towards the end of the year. [Defensive: As regard the ratification process of the Paris Agreement by the EU, the EU should be able to ratify it even if not all MS have done so. UK confirmed it would launch the ratification process by the end of the year. CULTURE Strategy for International Cultural Relations The UE adopted this summer a 'Strategy for international cultural relations' [presented by the European Commission and the EU High Representative] which encourages cultural cooperation between the EU and its partner countries and promoting a global order based on peace, the rule of law, freedom of expression, mutual understanding and respect for fundamental values. Culture can play a crucial role in strengthening international partnerships. The EU High Representative said: ""Culture has to be part and parcel of our foreign policy. Culture is a powerful tool to build bridges between people, notably the young, and reinforce mutual understanding. It can also be an engine for economic and social development. As we face common challenges, culture can help all of us, in Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia, stand together to fight radicalisation and build an alliance of civilisations against those trying to divide us. This is why cultural diplomacy must be at the core of our relationship with today's world."" Culture can play an important role in the EU's foreign policy. Cultural cooperation counters stereotypes and prejudice by nurturing dialogue, open-mindedness, dignity and mutual respect. Inter-cultural dialogue can help prevent conflicts and foster reconciliation within and between countries. Culture can help respond to global challenges such as the integration of refugees, countering violent radicalisation and the protection of the world's cultural heritage. Culture can also be a tool to deliver important social and economic benefits both within and outside the EU. In line with our EU Cultural Diplomacy Strategy we are strengthening our engagement with Singapore's arts and cultural community. This includes opening up our social media platforms to document key arts and cultural events here. The 26 th edition of Singapore's longest running foreign film festival, now a well-established event during our Europe Week celebrations featured 30 films from 30 countries. The festival, which ended on May 22 , gives audiences an insight into the myriad cultures and diverse traditions and ways of story-telling in Europe. This year’s selection, the biggest yet, also strengthened our partnership with Singapore film students.

HRC 33 - EU Intervention - Interactive Dialogue on the High Commissioner oral update on Ukraine,27.09.2016,27.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10540_en,,"33rd Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council Geneva, 13-30 September 2016 EU Intervention: Interactive Dialogue on the High Commissioner oral update on Ukraine Mr. President, The European Union would like to thank Deputy High Commissioner for her important update on the situation in Ukraine. The EU continues to follow with utmost concern the ongoing human rights violations and abuses committed at the expense of the people living in areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by so called 'separatists' and in Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia. The 15 th report of the OHCHR Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine brought alarmingly increased numbers of casualties and pointed to the volatile situation in eastern Ukraine that continues to have severe impact on human rights situation of people living in this area. We strongly support the valuable work of the Mission and we welcome its intention to take a closer look at selected areas of human rights concerns also through the thematic report. The areas of Donetsk and Luhansk experience a 66 per cent increase in civilian casualties since the last reporting period. Over half of all casualties are a result of the use of weapons expressly prohibited by the Minsk Agreements. Therefore we once again stress that it is important that all parties fully respect and implement their obligations under the Minsk Agreements as a first step towards a sustainable political solution that is based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence. The report shows persistent patterns of human rights violations and abuses like enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture and ill treatment. We are also concerned about severe curtailment of freedom of movement and freedom of expression; deprivation of humanitarian assistance as well as several cases of conflict-related sexual violence in so called 'separatists' controlled areas. The cases of persecution, arrests, ill-treatment and torture should be thoroughly investigated as well as all human rights violations and abuses. We are continuously alarmed by reports on gradual deterioration of the human rights situation in Crimea and by regression of fundamental freedoms, such as freedoms of assembly and expression, since Crimea's illegal annexation by Russia. It is concerning that Ukrainians opposed to illegal annexation of Crimea continue to be prosecuted in violation of the right to a fair trial by the ""de-facto"" authorities and in the Russian Federation and face harassment, torture and lengthy jail sentences. Crimean Tatars have been in particular subject to persecution. The rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated through the banning of the activities of the Mejlis, the self-governing body of Crimean Tatars, and by labelling it ""an extremist organisation"". We condemn it and call on those responsible for the situation on the ground to protect the human rights of all in Crimea. The EU acknowledges and supports the recent initiatives of the Government of Ukraine to undertake institutional reforms and to adopt constitutional amendments related to the judiciary to protect and enforce the rights and to replace the arbitrary use of power.  The EU calls on all sides of the conflict to respect international human rights and humanitarian law and in this context we stress that all international human rights observers should be granted full, free and unhindered access to eastern Ukraine and illegally annexed Crimea. Ms Deputy High Commissioner, What concrete measures in your opinion could be taken by the international community for the protection of fundamental rights of people who live in the territories controlled by Russian backed separatists? Thank you. Geneva"
Joint Statement on Syria,25.09.2016,25.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10431_en,,"Joint Statement on Syria by the Foreign Ministers of France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union The foreign ministers of France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the High Representative of the European Union have released the following joint statement: The devastating events in Syria this week underscore what we have been saying for some time: the burden is on Russia to prove it is willing and able to take extraordinary steps to salvage diplomatic efforts to restore a cessation of hostilities (CoH), allow unfettered humanitarian assistance and create the conditions necessary for the resumption of UN-led talks about a political transition. The outrageous bombing of a humanitarian convoy, the Syrian regime's public denunciation of the CoH, continuing reports that the regime is using chemical weapons, and the unacceptable ongoing regime offensive on eastern Aleppo, supported by Russia, blatantly contradicts Russia’s claim that it supports a diplomatic resolution. The Quint nations and the European Union High Representative therefore call on Russia to take extraordinary steps to restore the credibility of our efforts, including by halting the indiscriminate bombing by the Syrian regime of its own people, which has continually and egregiously undermined efforts to end this war. We welcome recent proposals made in the International Syria Support Group to enhance monitoring of these efforts. We reaffirm our commitment to the destruction of Da'esh in Syria and Iraq and urge Russia to follow through on its pledge to actually focus on this group. We also reaffirm our shared view that the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, is a terrorist organization and an enemy of the international community. Nusra rejects a negotiated political transition and inclusive democratic future for Syria, and we call on all armed groups fighting in Syria to cease any collaboration with Nusra. We demand immediate, expanded humanitarian access to all areas of Syria, including those on the United Nations' priority list, and we deplore the delays and obstruction caused primarily by the Syrian regime of humanitarian deliveries to Syrians in desperate need. We fully support the United Nations investigations of the use of chemical weapons in Syria and are resolved to take further action to address it. Finally, the Quint and the EU High Representative reaffirm calls made in this week's meetings of the International Syria Support Group for the Co-Chairs to continue their diplomatic consultations on these issues, but also underscore that patience with Russia's continued inability or unwillingness to adhere to its commitments is not unlimited.‎ We therefore also call on the UN Security Council to take urgent further steps to address the brutality of this conflict, and particularly the assault on Aleppo.

Remarks by High Representative Mogherini following the ministerial meeting of the Joint Commission on the implementations of the JCPOA,23.09.2016,23.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10296_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the ministerial meeting of the Joint Commission on the implementations of the JCPOA New York, 22 September 2016 Check against delivery! I just chaired the joint commission on the implementation of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, so called Iranian nuclear deal) on the ministerial level; the first ministerial level joint commission we held since last year, and one that was focused mainly on the state of play of the implementation of the agreement. The agreement is being implemented. We have three reports from the IAEA confirming that Iran has taken all the steps it had to, on nuclear related issues. As you know sanctions, nuclear related sanctions, were all lifted. This is thanks to the extraordinary work that has been done. And let me stress the fact that this is quite extraordinary in these days, these times we are living. This was really the result of team work of countries that keep their differences in some aspects, but in this file managed to put political will, determination, commitment, both in finding an agreement on an issue that was commonly recognised as a key one, but also in continuing their commitment together to get to the implementation. So the common assessment we've made is that the agreement is being implemented and this is again thanks to the political will, determination, the strong commitment to dialogue and teamwork among, as I said, the countries that might retain some differences but on this issue have managed to work together and will continue to work together. We have commonly expressed our determination to continue working together, going the extra mile, in continuing the work on the implementation. Let me also say that we all reaffirmed very strongly the political importance, the historic political importance of this agreement that has shown to the world and to ourselves, that even the most difficult issues can be solved through dialogue and diplomacy and with a win-win approach, overcoming the zero-sum game approach that sometimes blocks us in some of our talks and some of our negotiations. And let me also say that we are seeing the results starting to come also concretely when it comes to the European Union. I can share that we have seen this year, since the beginning of the year, an increase of 43% of trade between the EU and Iran compared to last year; that several European banks have started to facilitate transactions with Iranian banks. And we have seen an increase, greater than expected, in oil sales to European countries, where Iran has almost reached its pre-sanctions rate of 4 million barrels per day. So the trend is clear, the agreement is implemented, is being implemented. There is continuous political commitment by all, E3+3 and obviously the European Union to continue this way and the trends, the positive trends are quite clear. I can only say that we all believe that the good results of this agreement can help solving other crises, and I personally can only hope that the positive and constructive atmosphere and spirit that we have experienced in this meeting will continue to be with us for the rest of the day and the week, as we move to other files. Q & A Q: What about Iran's ballistic missile testing? No, I have already repeatedly stated, publicly, I think even in this exact position, that this is not covered by the JCPOA, the Iranian deal that deals only with nuclear related aspects, with the nuclear programme. I have stated that Iran's missile tests are not a breach of the JCPOA, obviously there are other political considerations that I can make, that are being made about the missile tests, but not related to the JCPOA; and as I said this is not a breach of the JCPOA. Obviously it does not help to ease the tensions in the region, it relates to other issues, including some UN Security Council resolutions, but it is not a violation of the JCPOA. Q: President Rohani told the General Assembly this morning that there is a lack of compliance by the United States of the JCPOA. Was this discussed in this meeting? We have discussed this, we discussed the outreach we have done, all of us, collectively and individually, we reached out to businesses, banks, to encourage engagement in Iran. This is a process that some of us might wish to see go a bit faster, reality is something we have to deal with, but as I mentioned there is strong commitment by all sides to continue in this direction that is already bringing some results, to accelerate the pace of it and as I said go the extra mile and continue working for the Iranian people to feel real benefits in their every day lives. It is extremely important for all of us that this agreement, this deal is not only fully implemented, as is the case now, but also that it delivers for the Iranian people and Iranian economy. So there is full determination. We discussed this during the meeting and we all agreed that we need to continue working in this direction with even stronger energy. Q: What have you discussed in the past days about Iraq, about the operation in Mosul. What is the EU expecting, especially when in comes to humanitarian aspect and lack of funds? This is not directly related, but I am happy to respond to that. As you know the European Union is not a military actor, even though we do have some military operations in the world, but not in that region, for clear and precise political choice collectively made in the European Union. But indeed we are committed and we are already working on the humanitarian aspects. The funds that we allocate for the humanitarian work are increasing, we are the first humanitarian donor for the entire Middle East, and we are also the first provider of development aid. The focus is in particular related to the work in liberated areas, related to de-mining, or to bringing back the normal life to the liberated areas. We are seeing very clearly that we need to invest in that in order to stabilise and for the people to be able to have their normal lives again in the liberated areas. This is an investment in security as much as, if not more than the military aspects. Q: On Syria, is there any initiative from the EU and the UN so that the peace talks reach its final point? I am just moving now to an important meeting on the crisis in Syria, of the International Syria Support Group, so I will not anticipate anything on that. For sure the European Union together with the United Nations can have a special role, when it comes to humanitarian support, but also on the political negotiations. The European Union has good relations with all actors in the region that have some influence with the actors on the ground. We do have contacts open with different parties in Syria. So we are ready and determined to offer all our active support to the UN mediation and obviously we hope that the military side of the negotiations, especially the one led by the US and Russia, would open the way for the political track to find more substance, and at that moment the European Union for sure will play a major role.

Joint Communique on Libya,22.09.2016,22.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10289_en,,"Joint Communique on Libya The following is the text of a joint communique on Libya by Algeria, Canada, Chad, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Malta, Morocco, Niger, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, United Nations, the League of Arab States, and the African Union. We welcome the participation of Prime Minister al-Sarraj in this Ministerial. We salute his leadership and the decision of the Presidency Council (PC) to liberate Sirte from Da’esh and secure the country from other terrorist groups. We reaffirm our solidarity with the Libyan people and express our sympathy for those who lost their lives in the fight against terrorism. We also welcome the efforts against terrorist groups as listed by the UN in other parts of Libya, including Benghazi, and commit to collectively pursue those efforts. We urge all Libyans to unite in their fight against terrorism. We reiterate our support for the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) of Skhirat, Morocco signed on December 17, 2015 and its fulfillment, and for the Government of National Accord (GNA) as the sole legitimate government of Libya, as endorsed in UN Security Council Resolutions 2259 and 2278. We support the preservation of sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and national cohesion of the Libyan people. Libyans should decide their own future without foreign interference. We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations Support Mission in Libya’s efforts under the leadership of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General, to facilitate the implementation of the LPA and support the PC in addressing the political, security, economic, and institutional crises facing the country. The international community will not provide support to or maintain official contact with parallel institutions that claim to be the legitimate authority, but which are outside the LPA as specified by it. We call on the Presidency Council to present a new Cabinet to be approved by the House of Representatives (HoR) as the legislative authority of State, and on the HoR to support national reconciliation by gathering all the Members of Parliament and fulfilling its duty to hold a free and fair vote on the revised Cabinet and on the Constitutional amendment to enshrine the LPA in Libyan law without delay. We reiterate our conviction that all segments of society from all Libya’s regions must find their rightful place in the political process. Efforts to obstruct progress, including with the proper functioning of LPA-mandated institutions will further jeopardize the security and stability of Libya. We call on the GNA to work urgently to restore essential services, provide humanitarian assistance, and create conditions for the safe and dignified return of internally displaced persons and refugees. We urge the GNA to resume oil production to strengthen Libya’s economy for the benefit of all Libyans. Given recent tensions in various parts of the country, we urge full de-escalation and avoiding provocative actions. We share the Libyan people’s desire to transform Libya to become a secure, democratic, prosperous, and unified state, where state authority and the rule of law prevail. This can only be achieved peacefully through inclusive political dialogue and national reconciliation. Only unified national forces can truly ensure security and defend the country from terrorism. We commend the PC’s efforts to unify professional military forces which include Libyans from across the country, and to form a capable, professional Presidential Guard to protect the PC. We urge swift progress in this endeavor to unify Libya’s military forces under the auspices of the PC and in accordance with the LPA. The GNA is the sole legitimate recipient of international security assistance. We stand ready to respond to its requests for international assistance to train and equip the legitimate Libyan military and security forces throughout Libya through an appropriately scaled exemption to the arms embargo for procurement of lethal materiel necessary to counter Da’esh and other UN-designated terrorist groups. We fully support the PC’s requests for security assistance to counter Da’esh and other UN-designated terrorist groups for a united national security force. We remain committed to upholding the arms embargo, and commend EUNAVFOR Sophia’s efforts to prevent illicit weapons shipments on the high seas. We support the fulfillment of the LPA’s mandate to keep oil infrastructure, production, and export under the exclusive control of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) acting under the authority of the PC. All oil revenues generated by the NOC must be transferred to the Central Bank of Libya (CBL), which must put the funds at the disposal of the PC. We support Prime Minister al-Sarraj’s call for dialogue to reduce tensions in the oil crescent and applaud his leadership in this regard. We welcome the recent transfer of the oil facilities in the oil crescent to the NOC as well as the plans to increase oil production and exports. We underscore that Libya’s national economic institutions, including the NOC, CBL, and Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), must function for the benefit of all Libyans as set forth in the LPA. The PC is charged with preserving and protecting Libya’s resources and patrimony for the benefit of all Libyan people. Libya's oil belongs to the Libyan people. We are committed to working with the PC on plans for stabilization and reconstruction in Sirte. We take note of the recent UN Humanitarian Appeal for Sirte and welcome contributions for its swift and full implementation. We underline the need for stabilization to all areas liberated from terrorism, based on principles of inclusiveness and local ownership. We urge the PC to launch the Benghazi Reconstruction Fund. We welcome the establishment of the UNDP Stabilization Fund. We express appreciation for the early actions by the UNDP Stabilization Fund to provide assistance to cities in all of the regions of Libya. We underline our firm commitment to providing the GNA with technical and economic assistance as requested. Over the next year the GNA must prepare for a peaceful transition to a permanent, elected Libyan government. We strongly urge the Constitutional Drafting Assembly to complete its work and present the draft Libyan Constitution for a referendum in 2017. We commend the continuous efforts of the neighboring countries in support of the UN-led political process. We stress the importance of regional support for Libya and its democratic transition. In this context, we take note of the decision of the Arab League to appoint a Special Envoy for Libya and welcome its determination to pursue its efforts to advance the LPA in support of a political solution. We also welcome the efforts of the African Union and its Contact Group in this regard. Bruxelles"

HRC 33 - EU Statement - Item 4: Human Rights situation that require the Council's attention,19.09.2016,19.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10032_en,,"33rd Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council Geneva, 13-30 September 2016 EU Statement - Item 4: Human Rights situation that require the Council's attention Mr. President, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Candidate Countries the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [1] , Montenegro* and Albania*, the country of the Stabilisation and Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the EFTA country Liechtenstein, member of the European Economic Area align themselves with this statement. The European Union is highly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide and welcomes this opportunity to discuss human rights situations in various parts of the world that require the Council's attention. The EU underlines that it is the primary responsibility of states to protect populations and take effective measures to prevent atrocity crimes. With regard to the situation in Syria , as well as the situations in Sudan, Ukraine and Burundi , we would like to refer to our interventions in the respective interactive dialogues. The EU is seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Egypt. The arrests of journalists, activists, protesters and human rights defenders, as well as the pressure imposed on civil society and on human rights defenders, including through travel bans, court summons, prolonged pre-trial detention and the threat of asset freezes, continue a worrying trend of restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly. Moreover, the EU remains particularly concerned about reports of torture, enforced disappearances, poor detention conditions and the handing down of death sentences, as well as mass trials and underlines the need for accountability for all violations. The EU calls on the Egyptian authorities to continue their efforts to shed light on the circumstances of the deaths of Italian citizen Guilio Regeni and French citizen Eric Lang and bring about justice. The EU is fully aware of the serious challenges posed by the terrorist threat to Egypt's stability and security, in particular the impact of terrorism on the Egyptian population. The EU recalls the need to tackle terrorism in full respect of international human rights standards and fundamental freedoms, as also enshrined in the Egyptian constitution. The EU also recalls the importance of assuring economic, social and cultural rights that are essential in order to achieve sustainable stability, prosperity and human security. The EU stands ready to help Egypt in fulfilling these objectives, taking also into account Egypt's pivotal role for the regional security. In China , the detention of human rights lawyers and defenders since mid-2015 and the harassment of their families remain as major concerns. The EU calls for the immediate release of all individuals detained or convicted for seeking to protect the rights of others or for the peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression, including Liu Xiaobo, Illham Tohti, Xu Zhiyong, Li Heping and Wang Quanzhang. The use of closed hearings and public confessions raise serious questions about China’s respect for its international human rights obligations, and for its own legal and constitutional safeguards and stated commitment to upholding the rule of law. We are also concerned by the reports that detained human rights defenders are regularly subjected to coercion and prevented from choosing their own defence council or receiving visits from their families. The EU is concerned that China’s new law on the Management of Foreign NGO Activities could hamper the development of independent civil society and urges China to provide a safe and fair environment for all NGOs to operate freely and effectively. The EU also urges China to respect cultural diversity and freedom of religion, not least in Tibet and Xinjiang, and foster dialogue with the different ethnic groups The EU remains concerned about the ongoing implementation of the laws on ""foreign agents"" and ""undesirable organisations"" and the ever increasing limitations on the freedoms of assembly and  expression online and offline in the Russian Federation leading to a shrinking space for independent civil society . The EU condemns the attacks against the opposition, journalists as well as human rights defenders. The EU remains particularly worried by the situation in the north Caucasus region. It calls on the authorities to align their policies with Russia's international human rights commitments. As regards yesterday's elections, we will wait for ODIHR's interim assessment. In Ethiopia, the recent protests in the Oromia and Amhara regions present a crucial test for Ethiopia's stability and unity. Only by increasing the political space and engaging in meaningful dialogue with all stakeholders can the legitimate grievances of the protesters be addressed and a peaceful outcome secured. The use of excessive force, killing and injuring, which we deplore, cannot be part of that.  We continue calling for restraint and for the release of those who were peacefully protesting and were arrested during the demonstrations, and support calls for an independent investigation into the recent events. An Ethiopia that accommodates its internal pluralism and growing prosperity is not only essential for its people but also for the country's contribution to stability and peace in the wider neighbourhood. More in general, we support requests for access of international human rights mechanisms to all UN member states, especially for HRC members. Regarding the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory , the EU remains gravely concerned at the reports of human rights violations. The EU firmly condemns all terror attacks and violence from all sides. A new outbreak of violence should be prevented. The EU underlines that the denial of Palestinian development and the settlements, that are illegal under international law, threaten to make the two state solution impossible. The EU is deeply concerned about the human rights implications of the increasing number of demolitions, as well as confiscations and evictions. The use of administrative detention, especially of minors, is also of deep concern. The EU is increasingly worried about the pressure and restrictions imposed on Israeli and Palestinian human rights organisations and the civil society. The EU recalls that compliance of all parties with international humanitarian law and respect for human rights, including accountability, is a cornerstone for peace and security. The EU calls on all parties to fully cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms. The humanitarian situation in the Gaza strip is of grave concern. Fundamental improvements in living conditions are needed particularly as regards the most vulnerable, i.e. children and older persons.  [1] The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process. Geneva"
Address by Ambassador Christina Lassen Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Lebanon - Conference: ''Syrian refugees… the Road of Returning Back'',13.09.2016,13.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10805_en,,"The European Union is fully supporting the United Nations-led process leading towards a political solution to the Syria crisis. It is an honour to be here today with key partners of the European Union. Minister Bassil, Minister Derbas and Mrs Kaag, I would like to thank you for your efforts undertaken in addressing this crisis. I would also like to thank the Maronite League, and in particularly President Klimos, for organising this debate on a topic of a vital importance for Lebanon and for all of us. We have all seen how the influx of refugees can spark massive challenges. Lebanon, hosting the highest number of refugees per capita in the world, understands the meaning of these challenges very well. The whole world has been impressed by the generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people faced with this completely unexpected situation. The question of refugees and migrants has been one of the main points on all our governments’ agenda in the past years, whether in Europe or in this region. We all realise how sensitive the topic of the refugee crisis is. But in this discussion we cannot forget that behind the numbers there are real people, real human beings that we need to help. Lebanon has been providing this help to the extent that many Lebanese ask themselves why and how long their country should continue to take on this burden. This is understandable given the sensitive composition of the Lebanese social and political tissue, the fact that Lebanon itself did not fully re-emerge from the war and subsequent conflicts, and that Lebanon has already been hosting for decades hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. And this is why the European Union as a close partner of Lebanon has been committed to do all we can to support Lebanon in this situation – politically as well as security wise and financially. Massive movements of people, whether in form of refugees or increasing numbers of migrants is part of our reality now. And the European Union is committed to play its role in the global response to this challenge. When it comes to the international response to the conflict in Syria, the European Union has been the leading donor with from the European Union and Member States collectively mobilised in humanitarian and development assistance since 2012. This support goes to Syrians in their country as well as to refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, including Lebanon. At the same time, the European Union is sparing no effort working with its partners to create the conditions for a political solution in order to put an end to the conflict in Syria, and to ensure that conditions are safe for refugees to return and to contribute to the reconstruction of the country. We all want the same for the refugees: that they will be able to return to their country safely. But to create safe environment for return we need to make sure that we are can take responsibility for their full protection. And this cannot be guaranteed when the war is on-going. The European Union is fully supporting the United Nations-led process leading towards a political solution to the Syria crisis. The agreement between the United States and Russia last Friday will hopefully pave the way for progress on this path. And the EU is ready to provide support to stabilisation and reconstruction, once a political transition has started. In the meantime, we need to focus on how to support Lebanon and Lebanese communities. The European Union has been the leading donor in the international response. Since the beginning of the crisis in Syria, the European Union has allocated more than €1 billion to Lebanon alone – almost 2 billion with the contributions of EU Member States. At the London Conference in February 2016, the European Union announced our willingness to assist even more: we pledged an extra €1 billion for Lebanon and Jordan for the years 2016-2017, specifically aimed at assisting these two countries handling the consequences of the spill-over of the Syrian conflict, with focus on alleviating the pressure on’ infrastructure and creating economic growth. At the same conference, together with the Government of Lebanon, we agreed to launch joint actions to strengthen self-resilience of refugees. Fulfilling them will help to protect refugees and to keep Lebanon stable. The main objective of our support is the stability of Lebanon: to enable Lebanon to come out of the crisis stronger and to make sure that as long as the refugees are here, they have decent conditions. But we also think about the Lebanese communities generously hosting refugees. Many regions all over Lebanon have experienced a huge pressure on their infrastructure in the past four years – whether we talk about schools, hospitals, water lines or waste management. We have worked to alleviate this pressure. To name just a few examples, our support has enabled 240,000 children – Syrians and Lebanese – to go to school, provided 750,000 people with clean drinking water and improved the access of 550,000 patients to healthcare medication and vaccines. The European Union and its Member States work exclusively on the assumption that the stay of the refugees in Lebanon is temporary. No one argues that refugees should be integrated or naturalised in Lebanon. That is why our support is aimed at strengthening  the resilience of the country to respond to the current situation better, but also to make sure that the improvements and investments we make – whether in renovating schools, building water towers or establishing waste management plants – will continue benefitting Lebanon after the refugees return to their country.  Ladies and Gentlemen, The current migration and refugee crisis is unprecedented and global in its nature. This is why the response to it has to be global. The arrival of thousands or millions of refugees and migrants is a challenge for all governments and we have to work together to share the burden. This is why we look forward to the two important events in New York next week, where the UN’s General Assembly will discuss these challenges and how we get even better in assisting refugees and migrants as well as the countries hosting them. To find a response to this challenge is not easy – we all know that. It may be – together with our joint fight against terrorism – the biggest challenge of our generation. The European Union and Lebanon are close partners, and we are in strengthening our partnership even further. With the close involvement of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, we have just negotiated a new partnership defining long-term joint priorities for our cooperation, as well as a major plan – the Compact – for how we can work together as partners even better to handle the challenges caused by the refugees’ temporary stay here in Lebanon. We are committed to Lebanon’s stability, security, independence and sovereignty. Lebanon’s security is crucial for Europe’s security and the example of Lebanon as the one place in this region where multi-confessionalism and open-mindedness still thrive is something we cherish. And we want to work closely with you to make sure that this remains the case. The crisis in Syria has developed into a conflict with more far-reaching consequences than anyone would have ever imagined.

"Inclusion of the Levada Centre in the ""Foreign Agents Registry"" of the Russian Federation",06.09.2016,06.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/9497_en,,"Statement by the Spokesperson on the inclusion of the Levada Centre in the ""Foreign Agents Registry"" of the Russian Federation With the decision by the Russian Ministry of Justice yesterday to list the Levada Centre in the so called ""Foreign Agents Registry"", the restrictions on independent civil society in the Russian Federation became tighter. The number of Russian NGOs labelled as ""foreign agents"" in the Russian Federation has increased to a total of 141 since the law entered into force in 2012. Targeting the activities of the Levada Centre, Russia's leading non-governmental polling and sociological research organisation, is of particular concern ahead of the State Duma elections of 18 September. We call once again on the Russian authorities to reconsider their decisions on branding Russian NGOs as ""foreign agents"", which is clearly aimed at restricting their independence and threatening their very existence.

Remarks by Federica Mogherini at press conference with Miroslav Lajčák,03.09.2016,03.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/9445_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference of the Informal Meeting of EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Gymnich) with Foreign Minister of Slovakia, Miroslav Lajčák Thank you very much, Miro. I would like to thank you personally, the Slovak Presidency and the Slovak people for this historic moment. Sometimes we focus only on what was happening today and tomorrow, and we lose sight a bit of how historic it is that Slovakia is holding the Presidency for the first time and in a very complicated moment for the European Union, for our region and for the rest of the world. If we can judge from these two days of intense work, the Slovak Presidency is already a big success and it is contributing a lot to common positions and moving forward on a series of important files. I would like to start with the last part of our work. We had an important session with all our candidate countries – not only Turkey, but also the Western Balkan countries that are candidate: Albania, Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – showing the complete determination of the European Union and its Member States to move forward with the EU integration process. In particular in the Western Balkans, where there have been a lot of achievements recently and a lot of common work on countering radicalisation and terrorism but also on the management of the refugee flows, on economic ties; we discussed together with them that they are great partners for us in our future work. We had this morning a long session with our Turkish colleague, Europe Minister [Ömer] Celik, who I met also bilaterally last evening. It was for us the first occasion to meet - all the 28 Ministers, myself - together with him and express our full solidarity and sympathy to the Turkish people, to the institutions of Turkey - the deepest respect on how institutions and people came together, also involving the opposition, to defend the democracy against an attempted coup. The European Union was very clear from the very first hours – I would say from the very first minutes – and Miro and myself were probably the first ones to react to that in defence of the legitimate and democratically elected institutions, starting from the Parliament, and we re-expressed today our support to the institutions and to the people of Turkey in a difficult moment. We understand very well that this can be a turning moment, a turning point for Turkey, also for the European Union and the relationship with Turkey. This is also why we will use the meetings we had today to prepare the High Level Political Dialogue we will hold in Ankara next Friday when I will visit together with Commissioner Hahn Turkey and hold meetings to discuss both bilateral issues, regional and foreign policy issues, but also common issues that require our cooperation. I would say that the main message that we all shared with our Turkish friend is first of all strong recommitment to dialogue. We need to talk less about each other and more with each other. We need also to listen to each other and understand - also the emotions in Turkish public opinion and in the European public opinion, provoked by what has happened in these last weeks, the coup and the reaction of the reaction to the coup - in full respect, with an open and constructive approach. And this is exactly the process that we have started this morning, I would say in a very positive atmosphere. We agreed that all previous agreements that we have among us will be continued and respected. The work is ongoing in all fields, be it on visa liberalisation, be it on the upgrade of customs union, be it on the management of refugees flows, but also on economic relations and energy ones. We decided that all tracks of engagement will continue in the coming weeks and months. We have also tackled some of the issues of concern that you are very well aware of, that are central for all Member States and the entire European Union. We discussed them all openly, constructively, with a reciprocal respect. And it is exactly because Turkey is an important country to the European Union and it is a candidate country to the European Union that we need to be so clear and so open about points on which we might have issues to discuss, namely the issues related to rule of law, the need to have fair trials, some issues related to media freedom and freedom of expression, and obviously the old debate about the death penalty that caused many worries in the European Union's public opinion. We reaffirmed - not only us, but also our Turkish friend - that the key point is facing all issues on our agenda. There is no taboo in our dialogue, but we need to face issues in a friendly, open and constructive manner. And I think we managed to do this today. We also, in the same spirit, discussed the Kurdish issue. It is very clear to the European Union and all its Member States that PKK is a terrorist organisation for us. At the same time we all believe that restarting a political process to solve the Kurdish issue, including a dialogue with the HDP, would be a positive development, exactly as it was when President Erdogan started it a few years ago. We also mentioned the possibility to work together in a constructive way with the Council of Europe, on issues related to the rule of law, and in particular the state of emergency that has been introduced in the country; and I am obviously in contact with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe [Thorbjørn] Jagland to follow-up this work in a practical way. By the way, this issue - the entire EU-Turkey dialogue and cooperation - is relevant to the EU and Turkey not only for our bilateral relations, it is also very much relevant because in many EU countries there are large Turkish communities. So this has been a very intense exchange, dialogue, as I said very constructive and very frank, and I am looking forward to continue it next week in Ankara. We also had two other points on our agenda. As Miro mentioned, we discussed our contribution as European Union to have a full implementation of the Minsk agreements to solve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We are seeing in these hours a ceasefire established for the beginning of the school year that is holding. We shared all together the wish that this could constitute a basis for further encouraging developments and we are determined to play our part, especially when it comes to the situation of the population in the east of Ukraine. There is a lot that the European Union can do, also in cooperation with the OSCE. We also discussed the implementation of the Global Strategy. I presented yesterday to the Ministers very concrete proposals and a very concrete timeline on specific actions we can take forward. There was an overall agreement, a consensus on the fact that this is the right way forward, so I will elaborate them further in detail and present again to the ministers and also to the ministers of defence in the coming days and weeks. Let me stress that obviously we will look at the entire spectrum of our foreign and security policy, but we paid a specific attention to the field of security and defence where we see space for the European Union to do more, and to do more together. We have the basis for doing this within the existing treaties. We have apparently the political will Member States to proceed in that direction, so I have put forward some concrete proposals to advance in this field very concretely in the coming weeks, and maybe the Bratislava Summit in mid-September could be an occasion on the level of Heads of State and Government to reflect also on these proposals. I will stop here and leave space for some questions. Thank you. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I125636  Q. Is it realistic that the EU gives visa liberalisation to Turkey? And is there a plan B for the European Union in case Turkey decides to cancel the migration agreement? As I said, the work is ongoing on all the agreements we have already started to work on in the last months, in a constructive way. This means that we have seen today a reaffirmation from the Turkish side to stick to the agreements we have in particular on the management of the refugee flows. And from our side on the visa liberalisation which is a separate issue, there are clear benchmarks on which we are constantly working on, both from the European Union side and the Turkish side. The work has never been interrupted at the working level over these last weeks. Just the day before yesterday, Commissioner Avramopoulos was in Ankara exactly discussing this issue. The framework does not change, the benchmarks are still there and the work to meet these benchmarks is ongoing. I hope this work can bring results and that we will manage to go ahead in the direction that we politically decided. Q. On Minsk agreements and the relationship with Russia. Is there a compromise inside – this meaning for example that steps of fulfilling Minsk process might mean that there will be steps of reducing the sanctions, so everything works step-by-step or is the position in this moment more in case not everything is fulfilled, there won't be a change in the sanctions? This issue was not discussed among the ministers to that degree of detail. I know that there is a debate in particular in Germany about this option, but this was not a matter we discussed yesterday. Yesterday we focused mainly not on the sanctions issue, but on the implementation of Minsk agreements on the ground and on what the EU can do - apart from the sanctions - to encourage, to push in the direction of a full implementation. Also because, as you know very well, I have repeated this from the very beginning, the real issue for the European Union is not the sanctions in themselves, but solving the conflict. And we should always keep in mind that our objective is contributing to solve the conflict. So yesterday we did this and we did, as Miro was mentioning, an assessment of the state of play, also introduced to us by the Foreign Ministers of Germany and France, [Frank-Walter] Steinmeier and [Jean-Marc] Ayrault. They provided to us an excellent insight on the state of play of the talks and we all expressed our support to the Normandy format, to their work in this format and it was exactly to that aim, to support this process, that we had this reflection yesterday.

Federica Mogherini remarks at press point following first day at Gymnich meeting,02.09.2016,02.09.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/9444_en,,"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press point after the first day of the Informal Meeting of EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Gymnich) I want to debrief you shortly on the two main points that we had on the agenda today with the EU Foreign Ministers, leaving the third - issue of Turkey - for tomorrow's final press conference I will hold together with the Foreign Minister [of Slovakia, Miroslav Lajčák]. This is simply because I will have a meeting with the EU Minister of Turkey [Ömer Çelik] in a few minutes from now and we will have the meeting with him tomorrow morning at breakfast so it seems only logical to me that we will leave all the comments on that for tomorrow. On the other two points on the agenda today, which are not less relevant than this one, we first discussed ways in which the European Union can further support the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. We always refer to the absolute need for parties to fully implement the agreements, which we consider as the key reference and the key way of solving the conflict. We see in these hours in the east of Ukraine a ceasefire that is holding and we hope that this can constitute a good basis not only for the restart of the school year, but also for a continuation of the situation in this respect. And we also heard from the French [Jean-Marc Ayrault] and the German [Frank-Walter Steinmeier] Foreign Ministers, to whom I am very grateful, an assessment on the state of play on the Minsk implementation. We discussed together ways in which the European Union can support further, in a more visible but also constant way, both the Normandy format and the different work that is done especially in the framework of the OSCE. We agreed generally on all sides that Minsk and the Normandy format constitute a framework to deal with the crisis in eastern Ukraine and that obviously we are not content with the present state of implementation of the accords. But we all agreed on the fact that these accords have helped to diffuse a very hot conflict in the past and that they constitute the basis we all support actively for the future. So full support to the Normandy format, full support to the Minsk implementation. As I told you this morning, we discussed concrete ideas on how the European Union can do more in this respect, in particular providing support to holding local elections in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions once the conditions established by the OSCE/ODIHR are met, giving some attention in particular to the intended OSCE police mission. We also discussed the possibility of enhancing our support to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which we are already doing, but we can do more. And we explored possibilities for increasing our support on the ground: short-term, with actions like financial and technical support to activities to improve the living conditions of the population, especially in the energy sector. Today the Vice-President [of the European Commission] Maroš Šefčovič was in Kyiv discussing the energy cooperation. You know that the European Union facilitates the trilateral energy talks with Russia and Ukraine. This is a field where we can definitely do more. But also we discussed the possibility for the European Union to play a leading role in the reconstruction of the country, in particular certain regions after the full implementation of Minsk is reached. Obviously we have also explored possibilities to have more economic projects and more humanitarian projects so as to help in the immediate term. We know very well that these kind of activities, including some technical support to activities like de-mining or supporting local governance, are key because they can be a basis for hope for the local populations and so encouraging the confidence-building measures. So, what I can stress tonight is definitely the full, determined support to the Normandy format, to the full implementation of Minsk, and an increased engagement by the European Union in support of the ongoing format and in support of the Minsk agreements.  Obviously – this is something I don't need to mention and is an ongoing effort - we will continue to talk about this publicly and privately both with our Ukrainian friends and Russian counterparts, as the European Union and Member States. The second point that I would like to shortly update you on is that we discussed with the Foreign Ministers - for the first time after its adoption - the Global Strategy and in particular its implementation. You might remember that at the European Council in June we adopted a Global Strategy for our common foreign and security policy of the European Union. Everyone at that time said ""excellent, we will now need to implement it"". Our teams were at work during the summer break to provide us a roadmap of ideas on implementation of the Global Strategy that I presented to the Ministers. Today there was a general agreement, actually a unanimous agreement, on the fact that not only that the Global Strategy is excellent, but also the plans for implementation are what we need now. So I will provide a clear roadmap by the end of next week on different steps of implementation. I aim at having the first operational results already by Spring next year, when we will have the first report on the implementation of the Strategy. This will include all chapters of our action in the world, meaning in particular the work on conflicts and crises from the very beginning to the very end: prevention, crisis management, crisis solution but also follow-up to crisis and conflicts and building resilience in societies and states around us, in the area around Europe both to the East and to the South but also in faraway places like in Africa and Afghanistan where the European Union is working a lot with our partners to increase the resilience of populations and institutions. A very important part of our implementation of the Strategy will deal with the nexus between our internal policies and our external work. This is perfectly understandable when we talk about preventing radicalisation and terrorism or dealing with counterterrorism, or migration. A perfect example of what we intend to do is the work we established on migration where we work at the same time on internal measures but also on external long-term investments in countries of origin and transit and anti-smuggling operation. This is going to be a comprehensive approach but I guess you might be more interested in one part of what I presented today to the Foreign Ministers, which are the plans for the implementation of the part of the Global Strategy that relate to the European defence and security. I presented them a rather detailed menu of options we have within the existing Treaties of the European Union of all possible actions that the European Union can take to increase the level of European defence and security policies. This includes issues that we will put on the table, also of Defence Ministers obviously and also Heads of State and Government. I don't exclude that at the Bratislava Summit in mid-September the Heads of State and Government might be interested in hearing what we discussed today with the Foreign Ministers when it comes to increasing the Europe of Defence. This includes the definition of our level of ambition, work on capabilities on the military side but also on the civilian side, and this includes also the full use of all our tools already foreseen by the Treaty, including the use of battlegroups for instance or the use of structured cooperation. I have to say that around the table there was also unanimity on the fact that - including on the issue of defence - the implementation plan I am proposing is going exactly in the direction that we need and I will proceed with this work so that we respond to the needs of our citizens, but also of our partners in the world, that we manage to have a more effective European defence and security. There were also ideas that I proposed and that I will also elaborate further of using the European Semester to encourage a higher degree of cooperation in the field of security and defence. The idea on which I will work now is to produce an implementation plan on European defence by the end of this year, in parallel with the work that Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska is doing on the European Defence Action Plan and in parallel with the proposals I will present on the implementation of the Joint Declaration we signed with NATO at the Warsaw Summit in July. This could constitute a package on the European Defence and Security to be ready by the end of this year with again not reflections or visions, but concrete proposals for actions. I will stop here. It was not so brief and I will take a couple of questions. Q: Can you just be clear on these concrete measures to help with [the implementation of the] Minsk [agreements]? Do any of them propose any EU boots on the ground to secure in any form the local elections in the east of Ukraine, or will that continue to be done entirely by the OSCE/ODIHR. And secondly, and following on from that, are you or are any of the Ministers that you've been talking to today prepared in the name of advancing Minsk, advancing the peace talks, to accept local elections in Donbas that are not fully free and fully fair? We talked about the possibility for the European Union to support substantially and actively the holding of local elections in connection with the work done by the OSCE/ODIHR. So the direct answer to your direct question: boots on the ground from the European Union there? No, definitely not. We will give attention to the intention of the OSCE to establish a police mission; this is possible. And we will now obviously enter into talks with the OSCE - with whom by the way we were yesterday in Potsdam - on ways in which we can increase the level of contribution or cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE on how we can help in this respect. But I would like you to focus not only on that, which is very important, but also on the fact that we decided to focus our continued support also on what can happen after the implementation of the Minsk agreements is realised, because we know very well that this falls exactly in the added value of the European Union's tools. When it comes to the economy, when it comes to reconstruction, when it comes to humanitarian, when it comes to interconnections, when it comes to energy, transport - these are all fields where the European Union – and only the European Union – can bring a lot. Our support to Ukraine, as you know, is already immense and will continue, and we can probably use it in a more visible way to encourage political talks. And when it comes to the conditions under which local elections have to be held, we stick to the standards established by the OSCE/ODIHR.  Q. Have you also been discussing sanctions as there will be discussions about sanctions in October. We discussed sanctions. I have to say there was no majorly different position; there was no major stand to get away from the already-agreed assessment that the lifting of sanctions is going to be linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. But the reason why we had this discussion on the Minsk implementation today with the Foreign Ministers is exactly to provide to the Heads of State and Government in October a basis for the assessment of the Minsk implementation, the assessment of the political process, and of the security process. The relevance of having different formations of the Council is that we can actually prepare discussions for our Prime Ministers and Heads of State with a sectorial approach. So for me it was very important to make sure that the Foreign Ministers had this opportunity to feed into the decision that the Heads of State and Government will then need to make in October on the sanctions; not talking only about the sanctions, but also talking about what the sanctions are connected to, which is the situation on the ground and our work to solve the conflict in Ukraine, because at the end of the day the issue is not the sanctions themselves, the issue is the resolution of the conflict, and we need to keep this in mind.  Q. On global strategy and defence, was there any discussion on the idea of having a European army? When it comes to the Global Strategy, what we discussed today are very concrete steps to increase the capacity of the European Union to be active and operational in the field of defence and security. As you know, we already have many missions and operations but there is much, much more that we can do at the service of peace and security. The European Union has its own way of interpreting security and defence, which is very much a link between the civil and the military aspects, which is unique and very precious at these times, and we discussed these concrete steps. We, I think, all agree among the Foreign Ministers that the European Army is not something that is going to happen any time soon, but what can happen very soon, if the Member States are committed, is to advance in the field of European defence with very concrete measures, and this is what I put on the table today. The important thing, I believe, is that all the Ministers, and I repeat all the Ministers, appreciated the plans for implementation and are ready to work constructively, and in a committed way to advance in this respect. So, I see a very clear window of political opportunity from now to next spring to make this file advance. There were always talks about the Europe of defence and little deliverables in the past years; I think that now it is the time for real stuff and that is why I put on the table these proposals. And again, this is only the beginning; it could be that you will see - even here in Bratislava - very soon some further elements on this.

EESC delegation to Moscow in support of a continued dialogue with Russian civil society organisations,30.08.2016,30.08.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/9000_en,,"The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) will be organising a mission to Russia on 30-31 August. The two-day visit will provide an opportunity for EESC members to meet with both the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation and other Russian civil society organisations. The EESC delegation will discuss the current situation for civil society organisations, and specifically the situation with regard to human rights and the environment. The visit follows an invitation by the Ambassador of Russia to the EU, Mr Vladimir Alekseyevich Chizhov, to EESC President Georges Dassis. As the European body representing European organised civil society in the EU legislative process, in line with the guiding principles of the EU's policy towards Russia [1] , and convinced of the need for civil society dialogue between the EU and Russia to remain open at all times, the EESC affirms its continued interest in engaging in people-to-people contacts and in supporting Russian civil society organisations representing different and diverse interests and views. Commenting on the visit, Dilyana Slavova, President of the EESC's External Relations Section, stated: ""Contacts between the civil societies on both sides form an integral part of EU-Russia economic and social relations. We are here today to give fresh impetus to and examine opportunities to expand our relations in the fields of mutual interest to European and Russian civil society"". The EESC delegation will meet its counterpart institution, the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, as well as Russian environmental and human rights NGOs.

Statement by the Spokesperson on the situation of Crimean Tatar leader and deputy Chair of the Mejlis Ilmi Umerov,27.08.2016,27.08.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/8961_en,,"The forced psychiatric confinement and examination of the Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis, Ilmi Umerov, who was charged of ""separatism"" in May 2016, represents a clear violation of international human rights standards. We call for his immediate release and, given the serious concerns over his health, urgent and appropriate medical care must be ensured. The European Union has repeatedly stressed the deterioration of the human rights situation in Crimea and Sevastopol since the illegal annexation by the Russian Federation. The rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely attacked through the banning of the activities of the Mejlis, the self-governing body of Crimean Tatars, and by labelling it ""an extremist organisation"". We reiterate our call for all Ukrainian citizens illegally detained by Russia, including Oleh Sentsov and Oleksander Kolchenko, who were sentenced one year ago in breach of international law and elementary standards of justice, to be guaranteed a safe return to Ukraine. The European Union remains committed to fully implement its policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Bruxelles"
EU wins a WTO dispute on Russian pork ban,19.08.2016,19.08.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/8505_en,,"A World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel today declared illegal the Russian import ban on live pigs, fresh pork and other pig products from the EU in the light of international trade rules. The ruling concerns a ban imposed by Russia in early 2014 because of a limited number of cases of African Swine Fever (ASF) in areas in the EU close to the border with Belarus. The panel acknowledged that Russia's refusal to accept imports of certain EU products and to adapt EU-Russia import certificates accordingly amounts to an EU-wide import ban. This measure is not based on the relevant international standards and violates the rules of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). Individual Russian bans on imports from Poland, Lithuania, and Estonia received the same criticism from the panel. The ruling sends a strong signal to Russia, and all WTO Members, as regards their obligation to respect international standards, in particular, in this case, the principle of regionalisation (which would allow trade from individual areas of a country which are recognised as pest or disease-free, even if the health status in the rest of the country is not favourable) and the requirement to conduct a risk assessment based on scientific evidence. The panel underlined that WTO Members can exercise their right to determine their appropriate levels of sanitary protection and to restrict imports accordingly on the basis of sanitary concerns only when this is done in line with WTO rules. The EU has one of the world's most efficient animal health and food safety systems, including high detection levels and stringent risk management rules. Today's ruling confirms that the measures taken by Russia against the EU have little to do with any real sanitary or health risks. EU products are safe and there is thus no need for any country to maintain unjustified import restrictions. For most of the products dealt with in this case, trade continues to be restricted by a politically motivated ban imposed on EU agri-food products by Russia in August 2014. Nevertheless, the panel's findings are of systemic importance, since they remind Russia about its international obligations and the fact that these cannot be arbitrarily ignored. The EU will continue to use WTO procedures to ensure that international trade rules are effectively respected. Indeed, the WTO dispute settlement remains the strongest option to tackle significant trade barriers and to thus increase legal certainty and predictability for trade. Russia's protectionist attitude affects a wide variety of other economic sectors. In the recent past, the EU has initiated WTO procedures on a number of trade barriers imposed by Russia, including recycling fees on cars, excess duties on paper and other products, and antidumping duties on light commercial vehicles. The panel report can be appealed within 60 days. If no appeal is filed within that deadline, the report will be adopted and Russia will be bound to comply with the recommendation.

Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides on the situation in Syria,03.08.2016,03.08.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/7748_en,,"Conditions on the ground in Syria are deteriorating, and as an active member of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), the European Union supports with a sense of urgency the work of the United States and Russia as the two ISSG chairs in creating conditions for restarting intra-Syrian talks. We join the ISSG chairs in urging the UN to prepare a proposal for political transition, based on relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and input given by the Syrian parties. This proposal should serve as the starting point for future direct negotiations facilitated by the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura who has our full support. We are ready to actively accompany his work in this direction. We are also ready to rapidly provide support to stabilisation, reconstruction and the return of refugees and internally displaced people to their homes in safe conditions, once a political transition has started. For this to happen, the entire international community must act collectively and forcefully now to ensure respect for the cessation of hostilities and the ISSG agreements on humanitarian access. This is essential not only to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people, but also for the parties to regain confidence in the political process. Any initiative on humanitarian grounds should follow the ""do no harm"" principle and aim at ensuring the full protection of civilians wherever they are. What is needed is an immediate lifting of sieges across Syria and unhindered country-wide humanitarian access. Any humanitarian operation should be led and monitored by the UN, ICRC and humanitarian partners, in line with humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality. It is for the humanitarian community to determine what assistance is necessary in besieged communities. The establishment of humanitarian corridors, in line with the Geneva Conventions and relevant protocols, should solely serve a humanitarian purpose and under no circumstances be part of a military strategy. Sieges, the use of starvation of civilians as a tactic of war, violate international humanitarian law. The deteriorating humanitarian situation in Eastern Aleppo as well as in other areas across the country where supply lines are being cut, demands immediate action. The EU calls again for an immediate humanitarian pause in fighting to ensure medical evacuations and the delivery of medicine, food and water from and into Eastern Aleppo and other besieged and hard-to-reach areas. The continued airstrikes and barrel bombs on Darayya and other areas across Syria are unacceptable. The EU calls on all parties to immediately halt any attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, in particular against medical facilities, schools, markets and internally displaced people camps; they constitute new and grave violations of international humanitarian law. Furthermore, reports of alleged chemical gas attacks are of grave concern. The EU looks forward to the upcoming report of the Joint Investigative Mechanism established by the UNSCR 2235. Bruxelles"

The EU-Ukraine Human Rights Dialogue was held for the second time as a dedicated full-day event since the start of the provisional application of the relevant parts of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. In the agreement, the EU and Ukraine express their mutual commitment to common values, in particular full respect for democratic principles, rule of law, good governance, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The meeting allowed for a thorough exchange of views on the human rights situation in Ukraine and on the country's commitment to achieving sustainable progress in this area, including increased adherence to international human rights law. The EU commended Ukraine for adopting the national human rights strategy 2016-2020 and the related action plan and underlined the importance of its implementation. Both sides agreed on the important role of the Human Rights Commissioner of the Ukrainian Parliament and of civil society in strengthening human rights protection in Ukraine. Discussions covered the developments that have taken place since the last Dialogue in July 2015, on a wide range of issues. Both sides shared their concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed by the Russian Federation in March 2014. Concerns were raised as well on the persecution of persons belonging to minorities, in particular the continued persecution of the Crimean Tatars, as well as the ongoing human rights violations in the non-government controlled areas in eastern Ukraine. The EU stressed the need to investigate and ensure accountability for all reported human rights violations committed in the context of the ongoing conflict and to ensure full compliance with International Humanitarian Law by all sides. The EU also highlighted the importance of protecting the human rights of internally displaced persons. The EU recalled that Ukraine has committed to the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Following reports from the Council of Europe's International Advisory Panel issued last year, the EU called for further progress in the investigations into the crimes committed during the EuroMaidan protests and the violence seen in Odesa on 2 May 2014, emphasising the need to swiftly bring to justice those responsible. The EU also raised the issue of preventing ill-treatment and torture and fully cooperating with international bodies to this end. Both sides noted the improvement of media legislation in line with the freedoms of expression and of the media and the need for rapid and consistent implementation. The EU also underlined the need to ensure the safety of journalists, particularly in the context of violence against journalists and impunity of the perpetrators of such crimes. Both sides deplored today's killing of the renowned journalist Pavlo Sheremet and agreed on the need for a swift investigation. The EU also critically noted that the publication of journalists' private data on Ukrainian web-sites had occurred. The EU emphasised that more action is required by the authorities in this regard. Non-discrimination policy was discussed, too, including the rights of LGBTI persons and those belonging to ethnic, linguistic, religious and national minorities, the rights of the child, gender equality and women's rights as well as the reform of the electoral framework. Additionally, the EU and Ukraine raised continued concerns that a number of Ukrainian citizens still remain illegally detained in Russia. The release of Nadiya Savchenko in May and of Gennady Afanasiev and Yuri Soloshenko in June was welcomed. The Ukrainian delegation was led by Mr Sergiy Petukhov, Deputy Minister of Justice of Ukraine. The EU delegation was led by Mr Dirk Schuebel, Head of Division for bilateral relations with the Eastern Partnership countries in the European External Action Service.

The visit was the Prime Minister's first to Brussels since his appointment in April 2016 and his first meeting with the HR/VP in his new capacity. It provided an opportunity for the High Representative to reconfirm the European Union's unwavering commitment to a strong, deep and broad partnership with Ukraine. One-hundred days after his appointment, the Prime Minister presented the state of play of his government's reform agenda and its implementation. Welcoming the achievements, the High Representative particularly appreciated that the fight against corruption remains at the heart of the reform process and its implementation. The European Union will continue to support the impressive reform agenda of the Ukrainian authorities, including financially - adding to the €7 billion in grants and loans since 2014, technically - through expertise, and with personnel, also through the continued deployment of the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Sector Reform. The HR/VP echoed the sentiments of the Prime Minister that such an ambitious reform agenda demonstrates a much-needed commitment to the Ukrainian people: to raise their standard of living and to provide for a more equal, fair and open society. The HR/VP and the Prime Minister also discussed the implementation of the Minsk agreements, particularly in light of an upsurge in violence in the east of Ukraine over the last two days, in which several Ukrainians lost their lives. The EU continues to support full implementation of the Minsk agreements as well as Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The European Union has recently prolonged its sanctions on Russia and has a strong and continued commitment to practical measures in support of the peace process, notably through ongoing assistance to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. The High Representative once again congratulated the Prime Minister for Ukraine having fulfilled all the benchmarks necessary for short-stay, visa-free travel to the Schengen area for Ukrainian citizens. This impressive achievement, which has been recognised by the European Commission in its proposal to lift visa requirements, should result in a positive outcome in the Council and the European Parliament in the autumn. Finally, the High Representative took the opportunity to reassure the Prime Minister, and through him the Ukrainian people, that the ratification and full entry into force of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement remains a top priority. A solution to the current situation is being sought as announced by the European Council in June. Bruxelles"

Call for participants global cultural leadership programme,06.07.2016,06.07.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/7038_en,,"GLOBAL CULTURAL LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME MALTA, OCTOBER 16 - 21, 2016 IN THE FRAMEWORK OF CULTURAL DIPLOMACY PLATFORM The Global Cultural Leadership Programme is a programme designed to develop and strengthen cultural leadership skills of young practitioners emerging on the international scene. Through its framework, content and methodology, the Global Cultural Leadership Programme specifically aims to improve the skills of cultural managers as well as develop collaborative peer-to-peer learning and networking building. This will enable participants to develop fresh insights into international cultural collaboration practices. The programme offers a set of learning modules, tools and manuals for practice-based learning, giving the participants opportunities to build meaningful collaborations at the global level and within the EU. BACKGROUND In March 2016, a new Cultural Diplomacy Platform was launched to support the European Commission with the implementation of a new 'Strategy for international cultural relations'. This Platform aims to carry out activities in order to enhance the EU's cultural engagement with third countries and their citizens. BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts, British Council, EUNIC Global, European Cultural Foundation and Institut français have formed a consortium, led by Goethe-Institut, to support the implementation of the Cultural Diplomacy Platform. This new European Cultural Diplomacy Platform aims to promote cultural engagement and cooperation between Europeans and citizens from countries all around the world. Its activities will, inter alia, address the managerial practicalities of establishing sustainable cultural exchanges, build long-term collaboration based on people-to-people contacts, and engage in productive co-creation processes. To that end, the Platform includes a training component: a Global Cultural Leadership Programme that will support young cultural managers from the ten Strategic Partners of the EU,  as well as from EU Member States, developing and strengthening their cultural leadership skills. OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES In line with the main objective of the Cultural Diplomacy Platform, to support the sustained development of cultural diplomacy policies, activities, methodologies, tools and training programmes, the objective of the Global Cultural Leadership Programme is to strengthen communities/networks of cultural leaders and practitioners, and to engage participants in an experience of international networking in a lean, practice-based and easily replicable learning framework. In terms of expected outcomes, participants will be empowered with new tools and cultural leadership skills that will strengthen their own insight into working practices, and offer them means to engage more efficiently in international cultural cooperation. We anticipate that this process will generate a multiplyer effect initially within their community of practice and subsequently into their local community. The training programme will instantly enable 40 emerging cultural practitioners (30 from the ten strategic partners of the EU  + 10 EU-based peers) to train and develop, on the basis of a peer- to-peer learning experience, new cultural leadership skills for acting/collaborating in a global working context. CONTENT Participatory group discussions and educational workshops will explore a variety of current challenges and opportunities, and provide knowledge and working approaches into: METHODOLOGY The Global Cultural Leadership Programme is a tailor-made programme for young cultural managers. During the training sessions, the methodology used is interactive. It is based on peer-to-peer exchange and cooperative learning experiences, and allows for establishing hands-on intercultural encounters on the spot, benefiting mutual learning experiences. Taking into consideration the overall aim of the training programme and its specific objectives, five leading European experts and educators developed a specific tutorial approach. This team of experienced trainers will be responsible to further design and implement the methodology of the course. The training methodology (problem-based, research-based, practice-based learning, action learning and peer-learning) will use a number of lessons learned, successful experiences and existing European training programmes. The Global Cultural Leadership Programme will provide participants with a four-day training programme that will include thematic exchanges and discussions, as well as workshops and lectures on contemporary issues of international cultural management. Participants will also acquire competences on cultural leadership through thematic participative problem-solving discussions, guidelines and reference documents, simulation exercises, group dynamics, examples of good practices, etc. The Global Leadership Cultural Programme is a starting point of a long term process that would enhance cooperation and co-creation Participants should also provide projects proposals in their applications that may lead to initiate and set up cooperation projects and follow up actions whenever relevant and possible. Training contents and supporting materials that will be delivered in the framework of learning sessions (e.g. in the framework of expert lectures but also in more interactive formats) will be collected in a dossier of learning materials, which will be made available to participants for further use during and after the training programme. POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS The 40 participants of the Global Cultural Leadership Programme will come from different fields of relevant cultural practice in their countries and represent sectors that are specifically interested in reaching out with their work globally. For the first edition of the programme, the European Cultural Diplomacy Platform will look specifically for applications from outstanding cultural managers who fill in the criteria below: Geographical criteria: Professional experience: Language criteria and age requirements: ORGANISATION The first cultural leadership programme will be realised in cooperation with IFACCA - the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies.

Message by High Representative Federica Mogherini on the occasion of the release of the Middle East Quartet Report,01.07.2016,01.07.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/7026_en,,"In times of multiple crises, we tend to focus on the most recent one. But particularly in times like these, we cannot lose sight of the conflict in Israel and Palestine. We need to shake life back into the peace process, and do it as a matter of urgency. Violence is on the rise every single day, with victims of both sides. We risk a new escalation, and the very chance of peace is slipping away. We cannot afford it. Too many Israelis and Palestinians are losing hope. But despair can only lead to more violence. We have a responsibility to give credibility to the perspective of peace. This is why the European Union has invested so much in the Quartet for the Middle East, working together with the United States, Russia and the United Nations. And this is why we have worked on the Report we present today. For the first time in over a decade, together with our international partners, we have set out what the threats to peace are, and what needs to be done to recreate the conditions for meaningful final status negotiations. First, the parties must work to de-escalate tensions and strengthen security cooperation. The Israeli policy of settlement construction and expansion has to come to an end. The Palestinians have to combat terrorism and refrain from all incitement to violence. The militant build-up in Gaza has to stop, while the movement restrictions need to be lifted quickly. Second, both sides have to move towards a two-State solution on the ground. This means to empower the Palestinians to take full control of their lives, including in Area C. And it also means to take into account the Israelis’ legitimate security concerns. Only the two sides can take responsibility for peace. The international community cannot substitute the parties. Only direct negotiations can lead to peace. But we need the political leaders to show their commitment, and implement the recommendations of the Report in full. At the same time, regional players have a key role to play. The Arab Peace Initiative offers a vision for a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In times of regional turmoil, some new opportunities for peace have also raised. No one can afford to miss these opportunities. Starting with the small steps, and moving towards a real political process, we need this work to begin. With the Israelis and the Palestinians, with key Arab players, with the whole international community – and the European Union will continue to play its role in full.

HRC 32 - EU Intervention: Interactive Dialogue on High Commissioner oral update on Ukraine,29.06.2016,29.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/4943_en,,"Mr. President, The European Union would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Simonovic for his important update on the situation in Ukraine. The EU continues to follow with utmost concern the ongoing human rights violations and abuses committed at the expense of people living in areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by so called 'separatists' and in illegally annexed Crimea. The 14 th report of the OHCHR Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine stressed that the volatile situation in eastern Ukraine continues to have severe impact on human rights situation of people living in this area. We welcome the Mission’s intention to take a closer look at selected areas of human rights concern also through thematic reports. The report indicates that there are persistent patterns of human rights violations like enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture and ill treatment, committed both on the territories controlled by the armed groups and in the territories controlled by the Government. All human rights violations and abuses must be sanctioned and come to an end. Severe curtailment of freedom of movement and freedom of expression, deprivation of humanitarian assistance as well as several cases of conflict-related sexual violence reported are alarming. The EU calls on all sides of the conflict to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, including by guaranteeing safe passage for all those who want to leave the area and for humanitarian workers to deliver aid. The EU is also especially concerned about the sharp deterioration of the human rights situation in the peninsula of Crimea, following its illegal annexation by the Russian Federation. This situation includes the imposition of a new legal framework along with the growing systematic discrimination and intimidation which are directed against the Crimean Tatars and Ukrainian speaking residents in Crimea. All reported cases of persecution, arrests, ill-treatment and torture should be thoroughly investigated and all human rights violations and abuses must come to an end. We are especially preoccupied by the ban recently introduced on the activities of Mejlis, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatars, as well as by other examples of the abuse of anti-extremism and anti-terrorism laws to criminalize non-violent behavior and stifle dissenting opinion. We call on the Russian de facto authorities to guarantee free and fair proceedings in accordance with basic principles of international law to all on the peninsula. In this context we also once again stress that all international human rights observers and monitoring mechanisms should be granted full, free and unhindered access to illegally annexed Crimea and eastern Ukraine. We acknowledge release of Nadia Savchenko and we urge the immediate release of Oleh Sentsov, Akhtem Chiihoz, Oleksandr Kolchenko and others whose detention in Russia is illegal and whose cases in breach of international law and elementary standards of justice. We once again stress that it is important that all parties fully respect and implement their obligations under the Minsk agreements as a first step towards a sustainable political solution that is based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence. The EU strongly supports the Ukrainian resolution and the extension of the useful oral updates of the OHCHR on the situation at the next sessions of the Council. We encourage Ukraine to pursue its cooperation with the OHCHR on all these essential topics. Mr Simonovic, What are the major long-time impacts and threats for the human rights situation of people on the ground, more than two years from the beginning of the conflict? Thank you. Geneva"
Statement by the Spokesperson on the criminal charges brought against Russian human rights defender Valentina Cherevatenko,29.06.2016,29.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6922_en,,"The criminal charges brought against activist Valentina Cherevatenko, a leader in the NGO ""Union of Women of Don"", represent the first criminal case opened under the ""foreign agents"" law in Russia. The practice of declaring NGOs as ""foreign agents"" cripples civil society and restricts the exercise of fundamental freedoms. This case is all the more deplorable since Ms Cherevatenko's outstanding work on human rights education, peace building, and humanitarian issues is well-known and widely appreciated. Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at a press point with the President of the European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of Israel Reuven Rivlin,23.06.2016,23.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6701_en,,"Check against delivery! Let me thank President Rivlin and share with him the fact that the regional situation and the security situation that Israel is facing is indeed a new one. Threats are increasing, some of these threats are the same that Europe is facing. But this new situation is posing also some new opportunities that were not there before, decades ago. For the first time cooperation with some key Arab countries in the field of security is there and it is in the interest of Israel and the Israeli people, first of all their security, to use this window of opportunity before it is too late for the security of Israeli people; and let me say also for the region and Europe as well as part of the region – we share the Mediterranean. It is because we know that Israeli people deserve and want to live in peace and security and that peace is the best opportunity for security and as we learnt from wise Israelis and as we heard from your words, Mr President, yesterday in the European Parliament. The European Union is working day and night, first of all within the Quartet with our international partners - United States of America, the UN, Russia. The Quartet report that will be published soon will indicate, we hope, common grounds, the way forward to overcome some of the obstacles that the international community identifies on peace and security. Second, we are working day and night with the regional players, Egypt, Jordan, our Arab friends to operationalise the Arab Peace Initiative to the benefit of security, because we know very well that the issue is not only between Israel and Palestine, it is also with the rest of the Arab World and this is the opportunity that Israel has in front of itself. Thirdly, we are working day and night with the parties. I will not comment on what President Rivlin mentioned about the presence at the same time here in Brussels of himself and President Abbas, but the European Union is constantly, daily working with both parties with a sense of friendship. We are convinced that we can be friends of Israel and friends of Palestine and this allows us to be bridge builders. We will continue to do so because nobody can replace the willingness of the parties to engage in direct negotiations to restart the perspective of achieving two-state solution. As the President Rivlin wisely pointed out yesterday, there is the need to rebuild some degree of confidence. There are things that can be done immediately: steps on the ground that would improve the lives of the people of both Israelis and Palestinians. And the European Union would be ready to facilitate and support. I am looking forward to continue our conversation. President Rivlin and I will continue with a meeting between ourselves and then also a working lunch with a certain number of Commissioners who will join us to discuss our bilateral cooperation, but also perspectives in the region. Thank you. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I123367 Brussels"
HRC 32 - EU Statement - Item 4: Human Rights situation that require the Council's attention,22.06.2016,22.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5670_en,,"Mr. President, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Candidate Countries Montenegro [*] and Albania* and the EFTA country Liechtenstein align themselves with this statement. The European Union is highly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide and welcomes this opportunity to discuss human rights situations in various parts of the world that require the Council's attention. With regard to the situations in Syria , Belarus, Eritrea and South Sudan , as well as the situations in Ukraine and Burundi , we would like to refer to our interventions in the respective interactive dialogue. The EU believes that the situation in Belarus requires the Council's continued attention and calls for the extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The EU remains seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Egypt . The arrests of journalists, activists, protesters and human rights defenders, as well as the pressure imposed on civil society and on human rights defenders, including through travel bans, court summons, prolonged pre-trial detention and the threat of asset freezes, continue a worrying trend of restricting the freedom of expression, of association and of assembly. The EU is, moreover, particularly concerned about reports of torture, enforced disappearances, poor detention conditions and the handing down of death sentences, as well as mass trials. The EU underlines the need for accountability for all violations. The EU calls on the Egyptian authorities to continue their efforts to shed light on the circumstances of the deaths of Italian citizen Guilio Regeni and French citizen Eric Lang and bring about justice. The EU is fully aware of the serious challenges posed by the terrorist threat to Egypt's stability and security, and in particular the impact of terrorism on the Egyptian population. The EU recalls the need to tackle terrorism with full respect of international human rights standards and fundamental freedoms, as also enshrined in the Egyptian constitution. The EU also recalls the importance of assuring economic, social and cultural rights that are essential in order to achieve sustainable stability, prosperity and human security. The EU stands ready to help Egypt in fulfilling these objectives. In China , the on-going detention and harassment of human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists and labour rights defenders and their families remains a major concern. Individuals detained for seeking to protect the rights of others and for the peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression, including Guo Feixiong, Liu Xiaobo, Ilham Tohti, Xu Zhiyong and Wang Yu, should be released. The EU also reiterates concerns about the treatment of five Hong Kong booksellers following the testimony from one about his detention and forced confession. The recent adoption of a national security package, including the counter-terrorism law, further raises serious questions about China's respect for its international human rights obligations and international standards, as well as for its own constitutional safeguards and stated commitment to upholding the rule of law. In view of that, the EU calls for full and faithful implementation by China of accepted UPR recommendations, including in relation to ensuring a safe and enabling environment for civil society, including foreign NGOs. The EU also urges China to respect cultural diversity and freedom of religion or belief of the members of different ethnic groups, especially in Tibet and Xinjiang, and foster dialogue with the said ethnic groups. The EU expresses concern about the ongoing implementation of the laws on ""foreign agents"" and ""undesirable organisations"" and the ever increasing limitations on the freedoms of assembly, media and expression in the Russian Federation leading to a shrinking space for independent civil society . The EU condemns the attacks against the opposition, journalists as well as human rights defenders and remains particularly worried by the situation in the north Caucasus region. it calls on the authorities to align their policies with Russia's international human rights commitments. We are concerned by the deterioration of the situation in Venezuela , which puts at stake the economic and social rights of the population, including the right to health and the right to food. We also underline the importance of respect for Venezuelans' civil and political rights, including the freedom of expression and assembly. Political prisoners should be released. Regarding the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory , the EU remains gravely concerned at the continuing reports of human rights violations and at the cycle of violence and loss of human life. The EU firmly condemns all terror attacks and violence from all sides. The EU is deeply concerned about the human rights implications of the increasing number of demolitions, as well as confiscations and evictions. The use of administrative detention, especially of minors, is also of concern. The EU is increasingly worried about the pressure and restrictions imposed on Israeli and Palestinian human rights organisations and the civil society. The EU recalls that compliance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including accountability, is a cornerstone for peace and security. The EU calls on all parties to fully cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms.    [*] Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.  Geneva"
Keynote speech by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the Oslo Forum,14.06.2016,14.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/4998_en,,"Oslo, 14 June 2016 Check against delivery! First of all let me thank you, Borge, very much for the invitation; Javad, for what has become a format in itself. We were used to read parallel statements, saying the same things in two different languages, when we were announcing good news to the world last year and still in January, the implementation day, when the tradition that I was reading out our statement in English and he was reading exactly the same text in Farsi. Since then, we decided that wherever we go together in panels like this we rather share, and so I say one part and he says the other part. Most of the times we agree and on some issues we might disagree as well, but we are definitely the format that is showing to the world that yes, the world is definitely not in a good shape, but if you work hard on finding a common ground and win-win situations, you can find a way to solve complicated issues. This is a reason for hope and also for working even harder on the many conflicts and crises we have in front of us. Now Borge is very nervous, because he is afraid that my Italian attitude would take much more than the ten minutes he asked me to speak for, and I will try to keep the promise of being very short. First of all, I know that this forum is a place for peace-makers and this is really a good thing to see in these times, where I too often have the feeling that the peace-makers are sort of endangered species. So I’m happy to see so many of you here – apparently there is still room for hope and indeed for a lot of hard work. Here in Europe we have the feeling that conflicts are spreading in our entire region, making our daily lives less secure; and I know very well that this is a feeling that other parts of the world share with us. I see many friends here, from Afghanistan to Lebanon; it is not only a feeling that is perceived in Europe.  The point is not only that we have a huge number of conflicts at our borders, the point is their complexity, the amount of actors involved, the variety of factors we have to address to achieve true peace and the inter-connexions among some of the conflicts and some of the challenges of our times. Challenges, as you said Borge, have never been so global, threats have never crossed borders so easily and we still have to cope with the complexity we are facing on the conflicts we have around us. We still have instruments that are linked to traditional conflicts, while reality is evolving fast. Just a few days ago, we have seen an American kid kill fifty people his age, and declare he was inspired by Da’esh. Each war has global consequences we cannot ignore. At the same time, conflicts are deep within each of our societies. And we need global alliances and internal work in our societies, as much as we need to act regionally and locally. So the complexity is also in the different levels of our action that is required to tackle any single conflict and crisis we have in front of us. In many ways, this is still a world of continent-sized powers. And we saw it during the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme – we saw it in an unprecedented way. If you think of it, never before, since the end of World War two, the United States, Europe, Russia and China had cooperated so closely towards a common goal. And it worked. And this has happened exactly in the time when many were talking about of a new “Cold War.” So not only it is possible, not only it works, but it works even when the narrative around us is pushing in a different direction. Will this cooperation last? Will this cooperation work also for others crises and conflicts we have around us? We in Europe, in the European Union, not only hope so, but we are trying to work for this to happen. It is absolutely vital for peace in Syria. It is vital for restarting the Middle East peace process. And it is vital for prevention; this is the right key to take in this moment. And Europe is clearly one of these continent-sized powers. None of our Member States, alone, is as relevant on the global scene as we are as a Union. I always say: the European Union Member States are of two kinds: those that are small and those that are not yet aware that they are small in this world. But together, as European Union, we are in the world’s G3. We are not just one of the three biggest economies: we are the first aid donor everywhere; we are the first foreign investor, the first trade partner for almost all countries in the world. And in today’s world, this so-called “soft power” is as relevant as traditional hard power – that, by the way, we do have also, but we tend to be wise in using it. If we pool together all our European assets, our diplomatic network is the first in the world. We are increasingly considered as a global security provider – from Colombia to Myanmar. If we combine all our tools, hard and soft, we are a true super-power. The choice is ours, of our European fellow citizens, if we are ready and willing to use the instruments and the strength we have at the service of peace. And yet, we all know that the global balance of power is shifting fast. This is not simply about the BRICS: the world is full of rising economies and demographic giants – medium-sized powers that do have a role in regional and global politics. In the Middle East and North Africa this is as relevant as it could be. None of the current conflicts – from Libya and Yemen, to the great civil war at the border between Syria, Iraq and Turkey – none of these can reach a peaceful solution if regional powers first and foremost are not fully committed to it. And this is exactly the reason why, after the deal with Iran last year, we went back to Vienna, not by chance, with all regional players - let me say for the first time with all the regional powers and I was very proud of that - to set up the International Syria Support Group. We did not expect all the differences between regional players to suddenly disappear: being a peace maker does not mean being naïve, on the contrary. But we all had clear in mind the alternatives to a political transition in Syria. With no peace, chaos would keep spreading. The influence of Da’esh and al Nusra would grow even further. And we could not even rule out a new escalation and open war against each other in the regional and international level. So the costs of a protracted conflict are far too high, for everyone and for Europe first of all. This is the message that we have constantly passed over the past few months. Still, there is something we cannot forget – in Syria just like everywhere else: that ultimately, peace has to involve all international players, all regional powers and all actors on the ground. All minorities, all parties, even all militias. If you want to make peace you have to talk to everyone and you have to find some sort of common ground: the win-win approach that made it possible to reach a deal last year. And, most importantly, all individual citizens - this is a story that President Santos always tells us - all individual citizens have to see the benefits of peace, have to see their own interest in peace. And this is something that Europe can offer. Peace cannot simply be crafted behind closed doors in a conference room outside of the country; it has to be done from within. We can facilitate peace; we can never impose it upon the parties. And here the European Union has a special role to play – although we do not often realise it, even within the European Union. Let me take the example of Syria: last year in Syria we helped host local civil society consultations, supporting Staffan de Mistura before he began his own consultations. And this week, as we speak, we are hosting in Brussels meetings of different Syrian parties and I will meet them tomorrow. Today, we are the only big donor with an active office in Damascus. In most countries, in the region but also in other parts of the world, from Asia to Latin America to Cuba, the European Union is considered and perceived as an honest broker – and this is the most powerful asset in the hands of peace that we want to make, not only for use of this but also put this as the disposal of the international community. This is the kind of engagement our European Union can offer: strong voice for peace on our global stage and in our region. A strong and honest broker in regional dynamics. And a force for good on the ground – with our diplomatic network, with our humanitarian aid, with our development cooperation and also with the energy of our private sector, our banking system – including in Iran hopefully very soon - and our NGOs. And we see and we believe that the world needs this kind of peace-maker. The world also needs this kind of European Union. And it is sad to me to see that some European citizens have to be reminded of that from the outside. But we see more and more friends from other parts of the world telling us that not only the Europeans and the European citizens need the European Union, it is the world that needs the European Union. Because we have our strength, but we have to be aware of it to be able to use it, and we have to be strong and united to serve peace in the world – be it in the Balkans, between Belgrade and Pristina or in Sarajevo, be it in Cyprus where we were together, be it in Myanmar where we witnessed the agreement, be it in Afghanistan, in support of women and a strong civil society, be it in the common work we are doing with Norway on Colombia and many other things. But for doing that we need to be together and we need to be united. I thank you very much. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I122718 Oslo"
"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press point with Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway",14.06.2016,14.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/4997_en,,"Oslo, 14 June 2016 Check against delivery! Thank you very much. I wish that all my visits and all my days were so pleasant, constructive and positive as my visit to Norway. We often meet each other around the world. That is also a testimony of how much importance we put in our work for peace, stability and security in the world. We are often sitting together in multilateral formats and also working hand-in-hand within the framework of NATO. I will actually move from here back to Brussels for the NATO Defence Ministers Meeting where I will find another Norwegian waiting for me. But Norway is really not only a like-minded country for us, it is a perfectly like-minded country. We work perfectly well together on so many issues that are important for Europe, no matter if it is European Union or non- European Union territory, because we are facing many challenges. We are also working on some opportunities and we have the same kind of approach and I would say even philosophy to investment into the resilience, the stability, the openness of societies, inside our continent and outside in the world. And we take the same approach: trying to find solutions, trying to find a common ground, trying to find a way forward, full respect of the international law and principles and a cooperative approach to the crises we are facing. So in this respect working together with you personally and working together with Norway is not only a pleasure, but also a fundamental asset for the European Union. I would like to thank you very much - and all your government and all the country if I can - for an excellent cooperation in so many different issues. And I am sure this will continue. And by the way, we are also looking forward to working more and more together on the Arctic and the High North where the European Union just adopted a new strategy. I will discuss this with the Foreign Ministers of the European Union on Monday; and also together with the EU Member States that are Scandinavian countries we are looking forward to working together more and more in this dimension as well. Q: On the UK referendum. Q:  I am confident on the decisions that the UK citizens will take. I will not comment neither the campaign nor the outcome. I can only restate what I said already, including here in Oslo, that is that from the angle of my daily work on the European foreign and security policy, the contribution that UK is putting into the shaping of the common foreign and security policy is key, is vital. This means that the European foreign and security Policy looks like it does because of the contribution of the UK among others, but also that the UK in this moment can utilise also the European Union instruments and policies in support of policies that are serving their national interests. I have many examples in this respect. The Operation Sophia that we have at sea where the UK is fully participating and has helped to shape, and the work that the UK is currently doing also in the UN Security Council on increasing the level of our fight against the smugglers networks, but also on the arms embargo on Libya – it’s a UK Foreign and Security policy priority, but is also counting on EU instruments that are common instruments. The same for the London conference on Syria where out of great UK ideas we managed to mobilise EU instruments. The same goes for the sanctions on Russia where obviously that makes sense when it is a whole Europe effort. So, no, I am not nervous. I will not comment on possible or potential results, but for sure as I said if the European Union foreign and security policy is it as it is – and in my view it is strong and effective, obviously you can always do more, but we are doing a lot – it is also thanks to the contributions of the UK. And the foreign and security policy of the UK can count on important EU instruments. Q. On the EU-NATO cooperation. We have worked very closely together, especially with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, from the beginning of our mandate to identify these areas and advance our very practical cooperation in these areas. I can give a few examples. We are working together on the Aegean Sea where NATO is offering a common framework for Turkish and Greek coastguards to cooperate in managing the migratory and the refugee flows and we have an excellent coordination at sea between NATO and the EU agencies and presence. We work together very closely on hybrid and cyber threats. We have a different membership, even if some Member States are allies in the NATO alliance and vice-versa, but we have different memberships and we are different in nature one is a military alliance and the another one is a regional integration project, the most successful one in the world. So we are different, but we can work together, especially in view of the NATO summit, to face together the threats and the challenges that our part of the world is facing, to complement some of the assets we have. Europe is very well-known to be a soft-power. We are not only a soft-power, we also have some hard-power. We have 17 civilian or military operations and missions around the world and in most cases we work hand-in-hand - in that case with the UN peacekeeping missions - and here again I have to say it is a very good field of cooperation also with Norway. So many areas of  common work and very fruitful cooperation. Thank you. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I122719 Bruxelles"
"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press event on the occasion of High Level Strategic Dialogue between the EU and China, with State Councillor Yang Jiechi",10.06.2016,10.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5011_en,,"Check against delivery! Thank you very much. Mr State Councillor, you hosted in Beijing last year the previous session of our strategic dialogue, which was extremely fruitful and positive. I am honoured and pleased to host you this year in Brussels for this session of the Strategic Dialogue that prepares the upcoming Summit between the EU and China, which will take place in Beijing, mid- next month. We had so far a very intense, productive and positive meeting that will continue in the coming hours. And this does not surprise me. The intensity of our exchanges is important. The State Councillor and I talked even recently at length on the phone and I also had a bilateral meeting with the Foreign Minister just last week in Paris. The European Union and China are both individually very important global actors and share the interest of having stability in our respective regions and some important fields of common engagement on the global level. So today we took the opportunity to prepare the Summit and to exchange views on a very wide range of issues. Last year we celebrated 40 years of diplomatic relations between the EU and China; and in this more than 40 years we have already achieved a lot. We will continue working together in the spirit of mutual cooperation and respect, facing growing challenges at the regional and global levels. We understand very well that working closely together is crucial for the prosperity and the security of our people. In particular we already discussed this morning increased cooperation between the European Union and China in the Middle East, which is essential for the security and stability of the world – and not only of the region. Our close cooperation on the Iranian nuclear deal has set a positive example to do more together in this area. So we discussed the scope of our cooperation on Syria, Iraq, Libya and the Middle East Peace Process. Other issues on our agenda today are our cooperation on managing the global phenomenon of migration that we see as a global responsibility, and regional security issues in Asia, in different aspects. I also have the opportunity of extending the invitation to the forthcoming Afghanistan Conference that we will hold in Brussels later this year in October. Other issues on our agenda are our relations with Russia, the situation in Ukraine, our cooperation in Africa, and counter-terrorism. We welcome, in the European Union, China's interest in having more cooperation on counter-terrorism at international level and the European Union is open to intensify cooperation with China through our existing political and security dialogues. We also discussed our relations in the areas of trade, investment and connectivity and I also stressed that the rule of law and human rights are at the very centre of our bilateral relationship. Let me conclude by saying that the European Union fully supports China's presidency of the G20 this year. When it comes to China taking a strong lead to implement the global agenda we have in front of us - be it the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as the Paris Agreement on climate change, or the need to work on economic growth worldwide - China is a key partner in both delivering climate actions and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and, as a P5, can play a crucial role in the Security Council. So I would like to thank you, Mr State Councillor, for a very important exchange. Even in the fields where there might be some distances, we always face them with the sense of respect and seeking cooperation and constructive solutions. President Tusk, President Juncker and myself will look forward to seeing Premier Li and yourself at the Summit next month in Beijing to take EU-Chinese cooperation forward to the next level, which is the level that the situation of the world and our regions require.

Speech by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the Global Forum of AJC,07.06.2016,07.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5035_en,,"Dear friends, It is such an honour for me to join this Global Forum. When I think of the speakers in the past editions – from Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres to so many US Presidents – I can only feel humbled, and grateful, for your invitation. I’m also particularly happy to be here with Susan and Claudia. In our meetings it happens so often to be the only woman in the room. Today AJC [the American Jewish Committee ] is sending a pretty powerful message with this “women-only” Global Leaders’ session. Well done! And today we somehow talk about women, and men, and their lives.  This is a very special day and moment to join you, for so many reasons. It is a delicate moment for America. It is a difficult moment for Europe, and for the Middle East – and in a few days  we will present, together with the other leaders of the Middle East Quartet, a report on how to preserve the two-State solution, and turn it into reality. Today is also the first day of Ramadan. And I am sure you will allow me to wish our Muslim friends all the best, and to do it from here. Because one thing Europeans have learnt – or rather, should have learnt, in our long history – is that religions should unite people, and when they don’t, we are all in trouble. But today also marks the anniversary of D-Day, and there could be no better opportunity to be here and celebrate the friendship between Europe and the United States. On D-Day a new chapter in our common history began. The free people of the world stood up against Nazism and Fascism. My generation can only remember the stories we heard from our grandparents. Just two days before D-Day, the Allied forces had liberated my hometown, Rome. We must all keep in mind how much we owe to those who sacrificed for our own liberty – be they Europeans or Americans, all together That was not simply a battle between two armies. On D-Day President Roosevelt reminded the whole world, what the Allied forces were fighting for: (I quote) “They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise.” And they won. In fact, that day we all won – because it was a victory against tyranny and racism. We all won, against the mad idea that one nation, one people, one ideology should enslave all others. That society would be stronger, “perfect,” with  all differences eliminated, with  all people  identical, with all diversity destroyed. But we won. We won against the Holocaust, the shame of our continent and of all human history. The Americans who died in Normandy, were not just fighting for America, but for the whole of us. They were black and white, Christians, non-believers – and Jews. And as an Italian, I can only be grateful to the Jewish Brigade for their contribution to the liberation of Italy. The possibility of a free and united Europe, was born on that day, on D-Day. And it was born thanks to our American friends. Our continent rose up, with America’s economic support, and friendship. The Transatlantic bond is written in our European Union’s DNA. This does not mean we didn’t have our tough moments. The AJC’s Transatlantic Institute was funded during one of those bad moments – back in 2004, at the height of the crisis sparked by the war in Iraq. And we must truly be thankful to the American Jewish Committee and to the Baruch family for having invested in our friendship right when we needed it the most. True friends know how to overcome difficult moments. The very night Barack Obama got elected in 2008, he spoke clearly about “alliances to repair.” Eight years later, our alliance couldn’t be in better shape. And let me tell you: Whoever the next President will be, I can only hope that our European Union and the United States of America will keep working together, as we’ve done in the past years. Hand in hand, always. Because in difficult times, there’s nothing you need more than good friends. Both Europe and America need our friendship to remain strong. The entire world needs our friendship to remain strong. In Europe, we know it well. I’m sure Americans know it too. *** And these are difficult times indeed. This is very true for the Middle East – and I’ll come to that in a moment. But these are also tough times inside our own societies. Times when anti-Semitism and racism are once again on the rise – including in Europe. We don’t want to deny it, we want to face it – and fight it. Four people were killed in a kosher shop last year in Paris. Four, the year before at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. Europe is today exposed to a new kind of threat. But it’s not just terrorism we have to worry about. There is also something else, and deep. We see movements and parties who nourish and foster anti-Semitic discourse. At a time of global uncertainty, and economic crisis, racism has become a shortcut for political leaders with bad policies, or rather no policies at all. Let me be totally clear on this. We will not close our eyes against the new anti-Semitism. We will not wait until it goes away – because we know: if  we don’t act, it will no go away. We have to act together. We know very well that this fight cannot, and must not, be left to the Jews: it’s a responsibility for all political leaders, for society at large, for our institutions. This is why our European Union appointed our first Coordinator on combating anti-Semitism, and I’m glad Katharina is here with us tonight. By the way, let me share with you a personal note: Katharina and I have known each other for many years. We met just a few hundred meters from here, in DC, when we were both taking part in the German Marshall Fund Fellowship… Talking about Transatlantic bonds, they also help Europeans get together! So, the EU has taken very seriously the fight against anti-Semitism. And we are working with our Member States to make sure that each kid in a European school knows about the Holocaust – because only knowledge can illuminate the true meaning of the words “never again.” Never again. Europe and America are the homeland of free speech. For this very reason, we know well what cannot be masked as free speech, because it has nothing to do with it. When someone is told to shut up just because he or she is a Jew, when a synagogue is vandalised – this is an insult to everyone’s freedom, and to the very idea of liberty, that is cherished by our Constitutions. Just a few days ago the European Commission signed an agreement with tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, to make sure that all illegal hate speech is taken down quickly and effectively. These are criminal acts, and must be treated simply as such. Jewish communities and Jewish culture are central to the social fabric of our continents, both in the United States and in Europe. Here in America you have always focused on where people are going, not where they’ve come from – and this makes your country such an incredible place. We have much to learn from you. I know this is not something you hear frequently  from a European. But while we work on it, and we continue to keep in mind our past – where we come from – let me tell you that in Europe, our history is impossible to separate from the history of the Jewish people. Let me tell you something about Rome, where I’m from – the “other” eternal city together with Jerusalem. When someone wants to prove he or she is truly from Rome, they say: “I’m a seventh-generation Roman.” This is almost certainly not true – and almost impossible. I am myself a first-generation Roman. But there are some cases: the only seventh-generation Romans I know – they are Jewish Romans. Rome would not be Rome, without its Jewish community. Even the food would not be the same, and this would be a real disaster! Europe would not be Europe without European Jews and their culture – that is, our own culture. And this is not just about history. This is about our present and future. It is about the very essence of our European Union. After the Holocaust, with the liberation from Nazism and Fascism, we decided to build a Union based on freedom, and diversity, and respect. Diversity is the foundation of our Union. Diversity is who we are, and who we have chosen to be. We have not given up our own backgrounds and identities. On the contrary. We have tried to build a Union where all different identities can live together, and grow together – the French and the German, the Eastern and the Western, the Catholic and the Protestant, the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim, and the non-believer. This might sound idealistic, in times when we’re faced with too many attacks against Jews, and against all minorities – as a matter of fact, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are rising at a similar pace, and anti-Semitic groups are very often anti-Muslim, too. But against this background, there is also some good news. Think of London. As you know, for the first time ever a European capital has elected a Muslim mayor. Just a few days ago Sadiq Kahn decided to join the Mayors United Against Anti-Semitism, an initiative launched last year by the American Jewish Committee. It was a powerful decision from him, and it really hints at the kind of Europe we can build together: a continent where our identities are not bound to clash, but to meet and flourish. The AJC really deserves our gratitude for this “Mayors against Anti-Semitism” initiative, and for your way of working. Your way of thinking, of living. It is not sectarian, it is not “tribal.” And we truly need this, in times of growing “tribalism,” in all our societies – in Europe, in America, and in Israel, as described by President Rivlin exactly one year ago in a powerful speech. The question is whether we want to focus on the “dividing lines” among our tribes, or look instead at what binds us together. It is a difficult challenge for all our societies. But I am convinced that what truly divides our peoples, is not religion or nationality. The only meaningful dividing line, runs between those who are ready to work for peace and coexistence, beyond our differences, and those who refuse the idea of living together in peace. That is what is at stake. *** In these times, it feels like the peacemakers are some kind of endangered species. The global security environment has perhaps never been so unpredictable and dangerous. And the State of Israel lies in the most fragile and dangerous region in the world. The spread of Daesh in the Middle East is a direct threat to all of us. The Muslim world is going through a massive “clash within a civilisation” – possibly the most violent fight in a century, to redefine the regional balance of power. It’s a complex one, and we could discuss this for days (and it would be an interesting and useful conversation). But one force, among all, is not for sure just seeking power, but power through chaos. Daesh is trying to destabilise all countries in the region and beyond, misusing and manipulating religion for their dirty fight for power. Against chaos, I know very well that working for stabilisation and reconciliation and even peace is an uphill task, that the war rhetoric can fascinate many. This is exactly what they want. They want the war rhetoric to win in our societies. And still, I believe there is no other way out. We need a new deal among all the peoples and the powers of the Middle East, or conflict will spread even further, to the entire region and beyond – Europe, Africa, Asia. Our European Union – together with the United States and the international community – is working to avoid an even greater escalation. We all know how difficult this is: our efforts for peace in Syria have faced a huge number of stops and goes, and a long-awaited political transition is still not at hand. But I am convinced that finally we are walking on the right path, together with our American friends. There is no other way to do this, than to reach out to all regional and local players, both the old powers and the new actors, Sunni and Shia, Muslim and non-Muslim. Only if we engage, can we try and move beyond a logic of confrontation, towards some kind of cooperation. This is the lesson Europe has learnt from its bloody history: regional cooperation is what can turn enemies into some kind of partners. You might not like your neighbour, still you have to share the same space. You cannot change geography as you can't choose your parents. I know we have different views on the deal we reached last year with Iran. But let me be as sincere as I can, on what I believe we have achieved in Vienna. One year ago we had no way to ensure that Iran would stay away from nuclear weapons. Today the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency are monitoring Iran’s nuclear program very closely. I chair regular meetings with ministers where we ensure that the deal is properly implemented. As long as this continues, there is no way Iran can develop an atomic weapon. And this makes the region, and the world, a safer place. This makes Israel a safer place. The sanctions that Europe and the US imposed on Iran were linked to the nuclear program. Sanctions are never a policy in itself: they serve a purpose. And when we reached our goal, we also lifted our sanctions. It is a matter of credibility, in a rules-based international community. I know some of you are worried, about Teheran’s influence in the region. Yes, Iran is a player, in regional dynamics. This is true for both historic and geographical reasons, and you cannot change either of them. The real matter is what kind of influence Iran exerts. Iran can choose cooperation, or confrontation. It has to decide whether it will keep threatening the State of Israel, or denying, or act responsibly towards a more cooperative regional order. I believe the Iranian people have an interest to choose cooperation – and we are making this clear to the Iranian leadership in each and every exchange we have with them. The people of Iran are asking for change: they are asking for their country to open up to the world, and leave behind a culture of isolation and confrontation. We must accompany the Iranian people, the Iranian youth. And we believe there is no better way to do so than to engage. The deal does not imply that all our disagreements with Iran have disappeared overnight. Or that they will disappear anytime soon. On the contrary, there are many things on which we know we disagree. And we will continue to monitor the full implementation of the deal. And as you know, Europe will keep cooperating with Israel on its security, and on regional security. As a partner, as a friend. *** I’ve seen a lot of chatter in the past few years about Europe’s relations with Israel. Many times I read of alleged “crises” in our relationship. Let me tell you about my experience over this year and a half. Whenever I talk to Israeli leaders, any of them, we all know that Europe and Israel are tied very closely. Of course this has something to do with our economies: our Union is Israel’s first trading partner; our cooperation on science and research has produced so much innovation, and so much progress. But there is more. Much more. We are friends. We are friends. And we will always be. Full-stop. Friends can disagree, from time to time, that's even healthy, on single specific issues or policies. But we are and we will always be friends. It is in our DNA and that will never, never change. We can and must trust each other. And on that basis, we can see what we can do together to achieve the goals we share. Just like the American Jewish Committee, our European Union works for a negotiated and viable two-State solution to the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It’s been a long time since Oslo. It’s been a long time and the conditions for two States have still not been achieved. And yet, to date there is no other option to achieve peace than two-States living side by side. In security and peace. I’ve seen your pain with my own eyes, in Ashdod, in July 2014, together with then-Foreign Minister Lieberman. I have seen the pain of a family whose house had been destroyed by a shell fired from Gaza. This is why we need peace. Those kids I met there deserve the normal life they don't have today. And the only way is bringing peace. I've learned it from great Israelis: Peace will come from security, security will come with peace. Let me tell you something: my first visit as High Representative was to Israel and Palestine. And I was the first to visit Israel after the last general election. During that visit, after a heated electoral campaign, Prime Minister Netanyahu publicly confirmed, standing next to me, his commitment to a two-State solution. And I was glad to hear that he, and other ministers, repeated just the same a few days ago, after the new coalition deal. Still, we are not moving forward. The opposite is true: the perspective we say we want to achieve of two-States is fading away. It would be great if new and meaningful negotiations could begin immediately, tomorrow. But we should all recognise that the conditions for this to happen are simply not there. On the contrary, the situation on the ground could not be more serious, and more dangerous. The stabbing attacks have become a sad new feature in the everyday life of Israeli citizens. Any incitement to this, and any other form of violence is totally unacceptable. And this is a responsibility that the Palestinian leadership has to take. But yes, settlements too are putting the two-State solution beyond reach, and Susan (Rice) made it clear. Some argue we should just wait for better times. In fact, that’s not even an option. If the situation does not improve, it will get worse. It is like riding a bicycle: if you don’t move forward, you fall. The next escalation of violence could spiral out of control. We don’t want to face the next Gaza war. We don’t want to witness to a collapse of the Palestinian Authority. We don’t want to see the propaganda of Daesh spread to the Holy Land and infect the Palestinian youth, and the Arab Israeli youth. We don't want to see this because we are friends of Israel. Our actions must be inspired by a sense of gravity, and a sense of urgency. First and foremost for the sake of Israeli security. We must aim high, but we must also deal with the reality we currently face, and be as pragmatic as we can. As President Shimon Peres said so many times, there is still light at the end of the tunnel – there is just no tunnel. This is the great sense of humour of the Jewish people… Our number one priority must be to create a new “entry point” for serious talks, as we also prevent things from getting worse. We need to be the “tunnel” that will lead us to the end of this conflict. This is exactly the aim of the Report by the Middle East Quartet, which will be presented soon. We will describe very frankly, as friends do, the immediate obstacles to direct talks, and the policies that threaten the viability of a two-State solution. We believe our recommendations will be hopefully a contribution to recreate the conditions for the two sides to get back to meaningful negotiations. With at least some minimum degree of confidence. With the united support of the key regional players, starting with the Arab countries and the key international players backing it. Ultimately, real change is in the hands of the Israelis and the Palestinians. Peace cannot be imposed upon them – this should be very clear to everyone. At the same time, war and peace in the Holy Places don’t simply concern the Israelis and the Palestinians. They have a very direct vital impact on the entire region. And they reverberate through the whole globe – in a way, the world does revolve around Jerusalem. There is a responsibility. The region and the world cannot shy away from their responsibilities. Our European Union pushed to re-launch the Quartet’s initiative – and the Quartet is indeed back to work. Europe, the United States of America, Russia and the United Nations, together: it’s the whole world trying to revitalize a peace process that today doesn't exist. We have also decided to work hand in hand with Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia – with the Arab Peace Initiative as a basis. And I know Buji Herzog was mentioning it earlier today. Because – for the first time ever – the Arab countries can represent an opportunity, rather than a threat, to Israel’s security. Please don't waste this opportunity. It's new, we have to use it. *** Europe’s commitment to peace won’t falter and won’t waver. Our Union’s internal debate is often heated, as it is indeed the case in Israel. But the fundamental choices of our foreign policy are solid, and they are here to stay. You will hear me saying the same message here, in Ramallah, in Teheran, in Jerusalem. We are friends, we are true friends. We are committed to peace in the Middle East. We are committed to multilateralism, and to cooperation beyond ethnic, cultural and political divides. We are committed to the two-State solution, and to Israel’s security. Our Union needs to engage with Israel even more – not to boycott Israel. Boycotting can do no good, and it would be an admission of our own failure. We are friends and we don't want to separate our future. In our part of the Mediterranean we say: “We are on the same boat.” For me – and for so many Europeans – Israel is a natural partner. We are and we will remain friends. Europe and Israel share so much, and the history of the Jewish people is the history of Europe. European literature would not be the same with no Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, Italo Svevo. European culture would not be the same with no Freud, Spinoza or Einstein. Our music would not be the same with no Gustav Mahler – or Amy Winehouse. Even our cuisine would not be the same… Too many times you have seen the sorrow and the pain in Europe. Too many times Jewish families had to leave their land and look for a new home. The Jewish people has suffered like no other people on earth. And in Europe we know it very well. Through centuries of diaspora, the Jewish wisdom has spread to the entire world, it has inspired so many peoples and cultures, and reached out, to the whole human kind. Jewish values and ideals have become part of our shared background. We share the idea that our actions have consequences, that they matter, and we are responsible for what we do. We share the idea of “ tzedakàh ” – that solidarity is not only a matter of charity, but of justice. And above all, we share the aspiration to peace – shalom. . Shalom, Salam, is a gift, but it is also something we need to work hard for – individually, in our own societies and together. This is the sense of the work we can do together – the American Jewish Committee, our European Union, the United States, the regional players, the whole international community. You will always find Europe ready to work for peace. Actively, quietly, humbly but stubbornly. We will be there. I’ve grown up to the dream of Oslo. I see it dying, in the Israeli and Palestinian youth. This is painful. In the political discourse, in our societies. We are giving up peace. Peace is something you shouldn’t give up to. We are starting to find this whole situation normal. It is not. And it is a risk no one can run. In Israel, in Europe, in America. If we want peace – because we know that only peace will bring security, for all – we all need to start building it. We have a responsibility. Together we can be peace-makers. And this is the most difficult, but also the most important, and most beautiful thing we can do, in these difficult times, in the history of our world. And to build it in beautiful, difficult part of the world. Shalom Aleichem, Salam Aleikum – may peace be upon the whole of us.  Thank you.  Washington, 6 June 2016 Washington"
Speech by High Representative Federica Mogherini at the UN Security Council on the European Union – United Nations cooperation,06.06.2016,06.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5041_en,,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Secrétaire General, Ambassadeurs, chers amis, Je souhaite tout d'abord remercier la Présidence Française pour l'organisation de ce débat – pour la deuxième fois en un an- , et pour sa capacité à construire des convergence globales. Celle-ci nous a permis d’obtenir le succès que l'on a vu sur le climat à Paris. Je veux aussi envoyer mes meilleurs voeux à nos collègues et amis musulmans pour le début du Ramadan. I shall switch to English. When we last discussed cooperation between our European Union and the UN one year ago, I had just taken office as the Union’s High Representative, and it was my first time in the Security Council. Since then, I came back to this room also to discuss migration and our fight against terrorism. And I cannot count all the exchanges, the meetings, the common work I’ve done with UN agencies all around the world, and with so many of you, in different multilateral formats. I believe this is the only way we have – as Europeans, as responsible members of the international community – to face these difficult times in the history of the world. The entire Middle East is in turmoil – with so many forces trying to redefine the regional balance of power, and so many people calling for an end to their suffering. Inequalities are on the rise in big parts of the globe. Climate change is challenging the economy and the security of large parts of our world. An unprecedented number of people is on the move. Tens of millions are fleeing from war, looking for a chance of survival, or for a better life. We often say that Europe is facing a refugee crisis. Let us always remember: this is first and foremost a “crisis” for the men, women and children who are going through it, as they flee their homes. And it concerns the whole world, it’s a global issue, not just a European one. But indeed our own continent faces a great deal of challenges. Our cities have been hit by terrorist attacks – just like so many other places in the world, in Africa, Asia, America. Hatred and violence are growing within our own societies. Together with inequality and insecurity, xenophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are also on the rise. In times like these, we need each other. We need all nations to come together, united. We need the United Nations. Because only together we draw the way forward, and make sure that tomorrow will be better than today. One year ago I told this Security Council that our European Union believes in multilateralism and believes in the United Nations. Today I can add that multilateralism will be one of the core principles and priorities in our new Global Strategy for foreign and security policy, which I will present in the coming weeks. But what truly matters to me, is that we are turning this commitment to multilateralism into practice, on a daily basis. This has also been possible thanks to you, Mr. Secretary General, and to the whole senior leadership of the United Nations. Our cooperation in these months and years has been truly excellent. And this makes such a difference, in so many places in the world. Our European Union has put multilateralism at the core of our common external agenda. We have learnt the hard way, that unilateralism doesn’t pay off. This is no time for global policemen. This is no time for lonely warriors. If we want to finally put an end to the many crises we face – and most of all if we want to prevent new ones before they explode – our only hope is to work as truly United Nations. The hardest the task, the stronger our cooperation must be. MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS In a moment I will talk about Syria, Libya and other crises that are constantly on top of our common agenda, and also of the news cycle. But let me start with a much older conflict, that will soon enter its eighth decade. Let us not wait for the next open war between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Because this is what will happen, if they don’t go back now to meaningful negotiations. The proliferation of conflicts and crises in the region of the Middle East is not a reason to forget about the fate of the Israelis and the Palestinians. On the contrary. The new security threats in the Middle East should push everyone to renew our efforts towards ending this conflict. This is first and foremost in the interest of every singe Israeli and every single Palestinian – and the events in the rest of the region make it even more urgent than in the past. A further escalation, especially around the holy sites in Jerusalem, would have grave consequences for the whole region. On the contrary, peaceful solution to the conflict – with bold leadership by both sides – could unlock genuine regional cooperation. The Israelis would benefit from it, and the Palestinians would benefit from it. The entire Middle East, Europe and the world – we would all benefit from peace. It would set a new paradigm of cooperation in the Middle East. Peace in the Holy Places would send such a powerful message to the entire world. That is why I made the Middle East peace process – if it can still be called a peace process – a top priority for our action, in the very moment when the perspective of the two States is getting beyond reach. The possibility of a secure State of Israel and a viable State of Palestine living side by side is fading away. And together with the perspective of the two-States, peace would also get beyond reach. The trends could not be more clear. First. Violence and incitement are not just inflicting terrible human suffering: they amplify the mistrust between the two communities. Second. Israel’s policy of settlements systematically erodes the prospects for a viable two state solution. It also raises serious and legitimate questions about the real Israeli leadership’s ultimate goals. Third. The lack of unity between the Palestinian factions is still a major stumbling block. Each of these trends – alone and combined – could make the two-State solution impossible to achieve. We would risk the collapse of all hope. The Israeli and the Palestinian leaders hold a responsibility towards their people, towards the region and towards the world. They can halt destructive policies and rhetoric, reverse the trend, and finally rebuild the conditions for meaningful negotiations. The future of it is in the hands of the two peoples, and of their leaders. Right now, we all know there is no peace process at all. And the international community can’t just sit and wait till the next war. We keep believing in Europe that the entire world has to do its part. Last year, the European Union pushed to revitalise the Middle East Quartet. We have had several meeting at principals’ level, to draw together the way forward. Here in New York we invited Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Arab League to also join the discussion. The cooperation among our envoys has proceeded for months. So let me thank the United Nations, the United States and Russia for all the common work we have done so far. A few days ago in Paris we discussed how the international community can help and accompany this work. As you know the Quartet Report will be made public very soon. We will describe very frankly the immediate obstacles to direct talks, and the policies that threaten the viability of a two-State solution. We will also make clear recommendations on the way forward. With one main goal: to recreate some confidence between the two sides, and the conditions to go back to meaningful negotiations. Because we are convinced that the current stalemate is not sustainable: there is no status quo, and we all know it. If the situation does not improve, it will get worse. And this is something no one can afford – no one, and first of all the Israelis and the Palestinians. SYRIA We need to be as realist as we can in analysing the difficulties, risks and threats of the region and of today’s world. But we also have to recognise the signs of hope when we see them, or when we manage to build them. It is a strong reminder that change is possible, and change for the better, if the international community is united and focused. Just in July last year this Council endorsed our deal on Iran’s nuclear program. The deal in itself was a major success of patient multilateral diplomacy. Six months later the deal was implemented. And we keep monitoring the full implementation of all its parts, counting also on the good cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. In parallel, the European Union is working to make sure that the benefits of the deal reach the Iranian people and improve regional cooperation. Because after the deal we all knew we had to build on the positive momentum. In November we met again in Vienna, where the deal was signed, with a new International Syria Support Group. For the first time since the beginning of the war, all regional and international actors were finally at the same table. Since then, let me say that Staffan de Mistura has been doing a truly amazing job, and much has been achieved. But we all know that the process has come to a critical point. It is vital that humanitarian aid reaches a greater number of areas. It is vital for too many people in need for help, and it is vital also for starting real negotiations among the Syrian parties in Geneva. We know how fragile this whole process is – and probably it will continue to be. So much blood has been shed, and national reconciliation won’t be easy at all. But there is no other way to stop the carnage, give hope to the Syrians and defeat Daesh. Europe is doing its part: we reopened our humanitarian office in Damascus, we are engaged on the ground as the first donor to Syria and the Syrian people, and we play our role in encouraging and accompanying the political track. Staffan de Mistura knows he can always count on our full and active support. I was myself personally in Geneva, meeting the parties upon his request, during the last round of talks. All international actors need to do whatever they can to make the cessation of hostilities work, the delivery of humanitarian aid move and the negotiations start, and finally move towards a political transition for Syria. Our divisions – here in this room, in the international community, in the region – would only benefit Daesh, and chaos. IRAQ And as I mentioned Daesh, Iraq must also remain high on our agenda – as a centrepiece for stabilisation in the broader region. Good progress has been made in the military campaign. The fight in Fallujah is on-going as we speak. But there are also concerns: the liberation of areas must be followed by rapid stabilisation and restoration of services. The EU is doing its part and will continue to contribute to both humanitarian and stabilisation needs. And the campaign against Daesh needs to be framed by an adequate political settlement. We continue to support Prime Minister Abadi’s efforts in this respect. All political players must seek a swift resolution to the current political impasse. We remain as international community committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. LIBYA And unity of the international community and of the region is also central for Libya. I know some had lost hope that the Presidency Council would ever be formed and arrive in Tripoli. But they have, and this would not have been possible without this Council’s unity and Martin Kobler’s excellent work. I know he is briefing you in a few hours, so I will limit my remarks to the European Union’s work on Libya – in strong coordination with him. In Vienna, last month we all restated our support to the government of national accord. Our European Union has started to mobilise a package of 100 million euros to make Libya’s new start possible and make Libyans live their lives in safety and dignity. Which is what they deserve. Last month the Libyan government has invited our Union to provide training to the Libyan coast guard and navy. I spoke with Prime Minister al Serraj about the modalities last Friday. For us it is key that anything we do is planned and delivered according to Libya’s full ownership and Libya’s priorities. Training the Libyan coast guard and navy will be an opportunity to put Libyans in the conditions of saving lives at sea, dismantling the criminal economy of human smugglers, controlling the countries territorial waters effectively, and creating a safe environment for Libyan fishermen. Let me spend a few more words on how we are working in the Mediterranean. Last spring, when we decided to launch a naval operation – Operation Sophia – against the traffickers’ networks, we asked for a Security Council resolution to endorse our mission. You were impressively united in doing so, and I thank you for that. Since then, thousands of lives have been saved, over a hundred assets seized and many traffickers brought to justice. On 23 May, we decided to extend that mandate of the Operation by a year. Now, once again, we are asking this Council to adopt a Resolution on authorising Operation Sophia to enforce the UN arms embargo on the high seas, off the coast of Libya. This is the course of action that our European Union has chosen: constant coordination with the United Nations, to best serve our collective interests, the interest of the international community as a whole. This is the place where international action should be discussed, decided and authorised. And I can only hope that this Council will once again do the right thing, and help us make the Mediterranean a safer place, for everyone starting with our Libyan friends. YEMEN With so many crisis taking the headlines, Yemen risks not to get the attention it deserves. Yet, the need for a political solution and for addressing the dire humanitarian situation is just as urgent there as it is elsewhere in the region and in the world. We support the Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed in his work. Progress has been made during the peace talks in Kuwait in the last five weeks, and I thank Kuwait for that. We should encourage the parties and players in the region to seriously engage with a constructive attitude. UKRAINE While we deal with Syria, Libya, Yemen, we could not forget of other crises, including at our Union’s Eastern borders. The end of the conflict in Ukraine remains a top priority for the EU. The Minsk agreements have to be fully implemented in all their parts, if we want the situation in eastern Ukraine to calm down. The UN office for coordination on humanitarian affairs is doing a precious job in mapping and organising humanitarian assistance there. The UN reports on human rights in Ukraine – financed by our European Union – are also of great help to monitor the situation. The European Union will continue to stand for Ukraine’s territorial integrity – and does not recognise the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. We are working closely with Kiev to help them achieve the reforms the country so urgently needs. So let me mention the important constitutional amendments approved just days ago, which will improve the efficiency and independence of the judiciary. But they really matter because they can also build momentum for the adoption of the amendments on decentralisation and other reforms. It is an important achievement. It is also an important opportunity to move the country forward – and to address the needs of all the citizens of Ukraine. GLOBAL SECURITY PROVIDER But our cooperation with the United Nations goes well beyond our immediate region. The more I travel the world, the more I realise that many of our partners already consider our Union as a global security provider. Colombia might sound like a far away place to many Europeans. And yet, we are following very closely the negotiations that could put an end to one of the world’s older conflicts. I was there just a few days ago to sign some important agreements, bringing already our concrete support to the peace process and in particular to the demining efforts. I confirmed to President Santos our willingness to engage even more on the implementation of the deal, as soon as it will be reached. Our coordination with the planned UN observer mission will be crucial. Moving to the other side of the world, next October we will host in Brussels a major international conference on Afghanistan . After so many years, a peaceful Afghanistan will only be possible if regional powers and the international community will also unite and accompany the peace and reconciliation process, and the economic and social development of the country. On this and on many other files the unity of the Security Council is one of the most powerful assets in our hands, for promoting peace. For instance, a greater involvement of the Council to monitor the security situation in Burundi would be most welcome. A UN police mission could deter further threats to peace in the country, and the EU stands ready to cooperate with the United Nations to this end. Our common work can build on so much positive experience. Take the Central African Republic , where the EU and the UN joined forces to restore the basic functioning of the police and gendarmerie. Our efforts contributed to the political transition and the instalment of new, democratically elected authorities. In the Democratic Republic of Congo , our European Union keeps supporting the work of MONUSCO and of UN agencies. The current political uncertainty risks to evolve into a full blown crisis, with spill-overs in an already fragile region. In fact, our common work cannot be limited to crisis management. Even if these difficult times require much of it. Still, the best way to address a crisis is to prevent it. And this is a field where the UN and our European Union can do so much together. RESILIENCE When we discussed Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, it was clear to everyone that Europe and the UN shared the very same approach to security and development. When we invest in growth, we are also investing in security. Our cooperation has started to yield results. The Paris agreement on climate, the Sustainable Development Goals – these are opportunities to overturn a narrow and short-term concept of security. We will now work to ensure their full implementation. MIGRATION The same approach has now become integral part of our response to migration and the current refugee crisis. I have already mentioned our Operation Sophia, and the great job it is doing together with Frontex, the Italian vessels and our partners – including NATO – to save lives and chase human smugglers. But there is much more than that. We need to prevent that those lives are put in danger – both at sea and in the desert, where thousands die far from our eyes and our TVs. This is why tomorrow I will be in Strasbourg to present, together with my colleagues in the European Commission, the plan for a new “migration partnership” with our friends in our region and in Africa. Migration and displacement are one of the great challenges of our era. Our response is the measure of our very humanity. There are some key facts that Europe cannot overlook, which will be central to our new partnerships. We too often forget that countries like Ethiopia or Kenya, let alone Lebanon and Jordan, host huge numbers of refugees. Hospitality is not an easy task: we experience it every single day. The closure of the Dadaab camp in Kenya could have dramatic humanitarian consequences – and our European Union is following the issue very closely, together with the United Nations and all relevant agencies. For these reasons we will further reinforce our Trust Funds, which are already providing healthcare and food to those in need, and are creating jobs for the refugees and for their host communities. But we also know that public money alone will never be enough. So a key component of our migration partnerships will be to attract private investments on key projects. Africa has a huge potential for growth, and we must manage to get the private sector on board. We must also offer opportunities: the best way to dismantle the illegal business is to work on legal avenues for human mobility. Europe needs to do its share, but we also count on our partners here – in the UN and in this Security Council – to do the same. I do look forward to the Summit in September, where migration will be recognised for what it is: a global phenomenon, concerning all of us. GLOBAL GOVERNANCE Stronger partnerships are the building blocs of our foreign policy. All today’s challenges transcend borders and national sovereignties. None of us, alone, can carry the weight of the world on its shoulders. But we all have a role to play, together with others, in a multilateral framework. So our European Union will seek more and more to reinforce old ties and create new ones. This is true in our bilateral relations, but it is even more true on a regional and global level. A network of regional alliances can truly contribute to global peace and security. That’s why we invest in regional networks and organisations. For instance, we have supported African-led peace efforts through the Africa Peace Facility since the very beginning, with more than 1.6 billion euros in the last ten years. It is now time to make sure that Africa’s capacities are provided in a more sustainable and efficient manner. This is first of all in Africa’s interest, to strengthen the continent and its regional structures against the many challenges it faces. Our cooperation with the African Union, with the Arab League, with CELAC and ASEAN can only grow stronger. In some parts of the world, we need to strengthen existing organisations. In other cases, we need new and creative formats. Our recent experience with Libya and Syria shows the effectiveness of ad-hoc formats working in close coordination with the UN envoys. Despite all setbacks, despite all the stops and goes, multilateralism has shown its strength. Formats can change, and institutions must be reformed. But in our conflictual world, where power is scattered and diffuse, global peace and security only stands a chance if our nations and our regions are united. Our European Union will always come back to the United Nations, to the core of the international multilateral system, to the stubborn idea of a cooperative world order. Thank you.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the Ministerial Meeting on the Middle East Peace Process,03.06.2016,03.06.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5052_en,,"Check against delivery! Paris, 3 June 2016 C'est une initiative très importante aujourd'hui ici à Paris pour amener ensemble les acteurs internationaux et régionaux sur la nécessité de relancer l'initiative pour la paix au Proche Orient. Ce n'est pas par hasard que cela se passe en Europe, c'est parce que l'Europe unie a mis parmi les priorités les plus importantes de notre action extérieure la résolution du conflit entre Israël et la Palestine et aussi entre Israël et le reste du monde arabe parce que nous savons très bien que la prolifération des crises et des conflits dans la région et dans le monde n'est pas une raison pour se concentrer sur d'autres priorités et oublier les conflits plus longs, plus durables de la région; mais au contraire s'impose la nécessité de résoudre la question palestinienne avec encore plus de détermination. I switch to English. This is because we see very well that the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East is adding on to worrying reasons for the vacuum that the prolongation of the conflict in the Middle East can create. The internal developments inside Palestine, inside Israel - on the political side, but also the deterioration of the situation on the ground with the risk of violence that is becoming more and more real every single day, with the policy of the settlement expansion and the demolitions, with violence and incitement for violence  - tell us very clearly that the perspective that Oslo opened up is seriously at risk of fading away. I am from a generation - like so many other Europeans and Arabs and Israelis - that was living in the conviction that Oslo would have opened up a time for peace for all of us. Today we see that this perspective is seriously, seriously, put at risk.  This is why we in the European Union are convinced that there is a need for the regional actors and international community to come together and try to facilitate talks, serious talks between the parties  on the two-state solution. We still don't see any other options for peace than the two states. What is important today is also the fact that we are finalising the work within the Quartet, so together with our friends in the United States, in Russia and in the UN, on the report that will be ready in the coming days, not only on the lines, the trends and the situation on the ground that put at risk the perspective of the two states but also includes some substantial recommendations on what the parties can and should do to get to the solution of the conflict; and what the regional and international community can do to support these efforts, to support this process, to create the necessary incentives and guarantees for the parties to engage in this process productively. The European Union has invested a lot in these renewed efforts from the Quartet to come to a substantial result because we are convinced that we have a special role to play. We are, as Europeans, the first trading partner of Israel, we are, as Europeans, the first financial supporters of the Palestinian authority. We are in good relations with all the key actors of the region, starting from the countries that produced what is still the most interesting basis for the peace negotiations which is the Arab Peace Initiative on which even recently we heard some openings, some interesting openings, from the Israeli side. We are working within the Quartet with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Arab League to create a framework that could, first of all, save the perspective of the two states and, secondly, recreate conditions for a process to be there, because we still refer to the Middle East Peace Process but the reality of facts is that in this moment there is no peace process at all. So the role of the international community, the duty of the international community, and of the European Union, first and foremost, is to recreate conditions for a peace process to happen and to restart. This is the meaning of the presence of the European Union here today and we will continue to work in this direction within the Quartet, with obviously all the 28 Member States of the European Union which on this are united, some of them present here as well, and we will have a further point on the state of play after this conference and - hopefully after the report of the Quartet - in the next Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June, where the role of the European Union in this process will be highlighted. I will stop here and take a couple of questions – English or French, comme vous voulez. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I122263 Q&A Q. L'UE prendra – t-elle en charge un groupe de travail après la Conférence et quelle réaction côté arabe sur cette volonté de relancer l'initiative arabe. A. Sur la possibilité d'un groupe de travail, c'est un peu tôt pour le dire. Les discussions sont en cours. C'est une question que l'on peut en effet poser et à laquelle on pourra répondre à la fin des travaux aujourd'hui. Sur le point du contenu, si je peux garder le processus de côté, il est clair que surtout du côté des "" incentives "" c'est l'Union européenne qui les a. Pour les deux parties. Et c'est bien sûr, soit dans cette perspective, soit dans la perspective que j'ai mentionnée du travail que l'on fait au sein du Quartet, c'est bien sûr l'Union européenne qui a les moyens, les instruments pour créer des conditions des "" incentives "" pour les deux parties pour s'engager. La réaction des pays arabes me semble très positive, très importante et dès le début vous pouvez le voir il y a peut-être un an déjà, j'ai indiqué deux priorités pour l'action de l'Union européenne dans le domaine du processus de paix - ou le manque de processus de paix - au Proche Orient: d'abord la revitalisation du Quartet car il faut avoir et construire l'unité de la communauté internationale. Les Etats Unis, l'Union européenne, ensemble, pas un seul des deux mais ensemble, avec aussi la Russie et les Nations Unies et avec - deuxième priorité que j'ai posée - avec les acteurs régionaux et surtout les quatre que j'ai mentionnés: l'Arabie Saoudite comme pays qui a pris l'initiative arabe, la Jordanie pour le rôle qu'elle a comme voisin mais aussi sur les lieux saints à Jérusalem et aussi pour son rôle pour les réfugiés palestiniens, l'Egypte comme pays clé, pas seulement dans la région mais aussi par rapport à Gaza et à l'accès à Gaza, et bien sûr la Ligue Arabe comme acteur fondamental pour le monde Arabe. Ce sont les deux lignes directrices que nous avons indiquées dès le début de mon mandat: travail dans le Quartet, avec le Quartet et travail avec les acteurs régionaux et arabes en particulier, et ce sont sur ces deux lignes d'action que nous sommes en train de travailler tous ensemble et cette initiative s'inscrit exactement dans cette perspective. Q . On recent declarations of PM Netanyahu on the preference for a regional initiative. A. To tell you the truth, to the Europeans it is not so crucial whether the Initiative takes place in Cairo, in Paris, in Brussels, in Riyadh, in New York, in Washington, in Oslo, wherever. The real point on which we all agree, in Europe for sure, in the region as well as far as I can see but I cannot speak for them, is that we need to put on the table something to move. It has been now two years since negotiations stopped. It is two years during which we had major conflicts in Gaza, a deterioration of the security for the Israelis, a deterioration of the socio-economic situation for the Palestinians, a deterioration in terms of the capacity of the Palestinian authority to stand. No one is gaining from this vacuum. So, no matter if it is Paris, Cairo, Brussels, the important thing is that the region, the international community and I hope the parties, come together with solutions to the situation. Because we always say that the status-quo is not sustainable; in reality what we have seen in those two years is that the status-quo is not a status-quo - it is the deterioration of security for the Israelis, and of the life of the Palestinians and of the security of the region. I would like to stress the point very clearly: this is why I find the initiative extremely interesting - let say the prospective of an Initiative in Egypt and the openings that Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed few days ago on the possibility of having this done-, because the security situation in the region is now creating a different kind of regional framework, also for Israel, that I believe would be a mistake not to take. I was in Riyadh a couple of days ago, I am constantly in contact with our Egyptian friends and also Jordanian friends and with the Arab League, I really believe that that would be the field where renewed process can start. But again, it is not about labels of who owns the process, the important thing is the process: have it started and have it meaningful because again. What I am worried about is the security of Israel and the sustainability of the situation on the ground. Q. The most senior official in the Israeli foreign ministry and one of the closest persons to Netanyahu, Dore Gold, said yesterday that this initiative will fail, like any decisions imposing on the Middle East have failed. Your view? A. There is no intention or outcome here to impose anything, and this has never been the intention of anyone. I can answer for the role of the European Union. Our approach has always been, and continues to be, that of creating the conditions for the international community and the region to support a process that has to be owned by the parties and has to come out of negotiations of the parties. This has always been clear to us. This has always been what I've discussed with PM Netanyahu, with all the Israeli officials and also with our Palestinian friends every single time. Our concern is how to re-create, or create rather, a framework, a united framework in the region and in the international community that could allow the parties to restart serious, meaningful talks, meaningful negotiations. I am convinced, we are convinced, this is the only way to achieve the two states. This is the only way to achieve peace. But it's also very clear to us that without a regional and international framework, the two parties will not come spontaneously, all alone, to the table by themselves. So, it is not about imposing, it is not about dictating, it is not even about indicating the steps or the content. It is about creating the space, the possibility, the framework—again, I stress, united—for the parties to reengage seriously, credibly I would say.  And, I would stress, to revert the trends. Because in these last two years the trends have been negative for all—Palestinians and Israelis. If you look at the security of Israel today, it's more serious. If we look at the situation on the ground for the Palestinians, be it in Gaza, be it in the West Bank, it's more serious today. And the risk of this deteriorating even further is not in the interest first and foremost of the Israelis, of the Palestinians, but also of the region and also of the Europeans. We have an interest in finding a solution to this. The solution will have to come from the parties, but we have the responsibility and the duty to unite the region and international community to make this possible, and facilitate if we can. Paris,"

Doorstep remarks by the HRVP Federica Mogherini at the NATO Foreign Ministers Meeting,20.05.2016,20.05.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6270_en,,"Brussels, 20 May 2016 Thank you very much, Jens. It is a pleasure to be back. You highlighted in a perfect way how, during this one year and a half of our parallel mandates, we have really energised and intensified the cooperation between the European Union and NATO. It was our intention to do so and, indeed, the preparation for the Warsaw Summit in July and of the European Council taking place a few weeks before, will create an excellent synergy for highlighting the fields where working together brings an added-value. You mentioned many of them as well as the very concrete things on which we are working or on which we have been working. Let me also thank you for your constant presence to the meetings of EU Defence Ministers and the constant invitation you extend to me to attend the Ministerial meetings in NATO – in both Foreign Ministers and Defence Ministers formats. You mentioned concrete and clear things we are doing together on hybrid threats, on cyber. There are other three elements where our cooperation is excellent and brings a real added value. The first one is maritime security. We are working very well together in the Aegean Sea. We are obviously looking at ways in which we can work together and how NATO can support the activities of the European Union, in particular the Operation Sophia in the Central Mediterranean, to dismantle the traffickers business. But also Maritime Security at large in other parts of the world. There are theatres where we are both present. In the Balkans for sure, where our cooperation is key to the stability of countries that are extremely important for both NATO and the European Union; and in other countries that are a bit more far away, like Afghanistan, and for whom the Warsaw Summit will provide an excellent complement, from an European point of view, to the Brussels conference that we will organise with Afghanistan on the civilian part – so on the political and pledging support to the country in early October. This is a perfect example on how our two organisations - that are different but complementary somehow - can work together and bring an added value in terms of stability and security in the world. Let me add a last point. I am personally very glad that Montenegro signed the Accession Protocol. This is something, I believe, that highlights very well the complementarity of our work. I stop here because our statements were complementary and I do not have to mention things on which we are working together and you mentioned already. Thank you. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I121125  Q&A Q: On the support NATO could give to the EU in the Central Mediterranean to Operation Sofia and other efforts A: When it comes to the Mediterranean, you know very well, we have already a coordination mechanism in place, SHADE, that is working very well and we have the experience in the Aegean that is working indeed in a perfect way. It is true the situation in the Aegean and the situation in the Central Mediterranean are different: the geography is different, the situation we are facing there is different. The kind of European Union's presence is also different: in the Central Mediterranean we have a naval operation up and running since several months, which is operational and that has achieved already some important results: saving lives but also apprehending almost 70 suspected smugglers and neutralising more than 100 boats. As we moved to potential additional tasks of the Operation, such as the training of the coastguards of Libya or the potential work on the implementation of the UNSC resolution on the arms embargo, we would need also to strengthen our assets and our capacities. The support and the cooperation with NATO in this respect could be essential. There are different, many, many different valuable ways in which NATO could support our work in the Mediterranean. For sure, and we have started to discuss that, when it comes to intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance capabilities but also when it comes to communication system, logistics. There is a lot that NATO and the European Union can do together in the Central Mediterranean. The important thing in this, and we agreed, is that we put our action at the service of the security of the Mediterranean and the security of the lives of the people who are crossing the Mediterranean, but also at the service of our objective to dismantle the networks of smugglers.  We can (…) but in a coordinated way so that we do not have any overlapping and that we manage to support the efforts that are already ongoing. And I am sure that we will work in that direction, in a very practical way as we managed to do very effectively in the Aegean. Q: Russia's war against UA is now in its 3rd year. Is it time to start talking about increasing sanctions and imposing a timeline to meet its Minsk obligations? A: You know very well that decisions on the existing sanctions have been taken even recently. Let me also underline that all those that were foreseeing divisions in the European Union were always proven wrong. We have managed to build and keep our unity. Even if we have different points of view – and this is an element of richness of the EU, not an element of weakness – we manage to unite the differences on a single policy and be united on its implementation. We will have a political discussion in the coming weeks with the Member States on the rollover of the existing sanctions. There is no discussion at the moment on increasing the level of sanctions. And I also mentioned in the last days the need to have, at a certain moment this year, a political reflection - I believe guided by Germany and France as the European members of the Normandy format, together with the European Union obviously - on the assessment of the Minsk implementation and the way forward. But we are working every single day - and every single night, most of the time - on the Minsk implementation. This is needed on all sides and in full. And this remains the European Union's united position. Bruxelles"

Statement of the International Syria Support Group,17.05.2016,17.05.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2802_en,,"Meeting in Vienna on May 17, 2016, as the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), the Arab League, Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, the European Union, France, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, The Netherlands, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United Nations, and the United States reaffirmed the ISSG’s determination to strengthen the Cessation of Hostilities, to ensure full and sustained humanitarian access in Syria, and to ensure progress toward a peaceful political transition. Cessation of Hostilities Members, emphasizing the importance of a full cessation of hostilities to decreasing violence and saving lives, stressed the need to solidify the cessation in the face of serious threats, particularly during the past several weeks. The members welcomed the Joint Statement of May 9 by Ceasefire Task Force Co-Chairs, the Russian Federation and the United States, recommitting them to intensify efforts to ensure the cessation’s nationwide implementation. In this regard, they welcomed the ongoing work of the Task Force and other mechanisms to facilitate solidifying of the cessation such as the UN Operations Center and Russian-U.S. Coordination Cell in Geneva. The ISSG Members urged full compliance of the parties to the terms of the cessation, including the ceasing of offensive operations, and undertook to use their influence with the parties to the cessation to obtain this compliance. Additionally, the ISSG called upon all parties to the cessation to refrain from disproportionate responses to provocations and to demonstrate restraint. If the commitments of the parties to the cessation are not implemented in good faith, the consequences could include the return of full-scale war, which all the Members of the ISSG agreed would be in no one’s interest. Where the co-chairs believe that a party to the cessation of hostilities has engaged in a pattern of persistent non-compliance, the Task Force could refer such behavior to the ISSG Ministers or those designated by the Ministers to determine appropriate action, including the exclusion of such parties from the arrangements of the cessation and the protection it affords them. Moreover, the failure of the cessation of hostilities and/or of the granting of access to the delivery of humanitarian relief will increase international pressure ýon those failing to live up to these commitments. Noting previous calls by the ISSG and the unanimously-adopted UNSCR 2254 of December 18, 2015, the ISSG reiterated its condemnation of the indiscriminate attacks by any party to the conflict. The ISSG expressed its serious concern about growing civilian casualties in recent weeks, making clear that the attacks on civilians, including attacks on medical facilities, by any party, is completely unacceptable. The ISSG took note of the March 2016 commitment by the Syrian government not to engage in indiscriminate use of force and urged the fulfillment of that commitment. The ISSG committed to intensifying its efforts to get the parties to stop any further indiscriminate use of force, and welcomed the Russian Federation’s commitment in the Joint Statement of May 9 to “work with the Syrian authorities to minimize aviation operations over areas predominantly inhabited by civilians or parties to the cessation, as well as the United States’ commitment to intensifying its support and assistance to regional allies to help them prevent the flow of fighters, weapons, or financial support to terrorist organizations across their borders.” The ISSG, noting that Da’esh and the Nusra Front are designated by the UN Security Council as terrorist organizations, urged that the international community do all it can to prevent any material or financial support from reaching these groups and dissuade any party to the cessation from fighting in collaboration with them. The ISSG supports efforts by the co-chairs of the Ceasefire Task Force to develop a shared understanding of the threat posed, and delineation of the territory controlled, by Da’esh and the Nusra Front, and to consider ways to deal decisively with the threat posed by Da’esh and the Nusra Front to Syria and international security. The ISSG stressed that in taking action against these two groups, the parties should avoid any attacks on parties to the cessation and any attacks on civilians, in accordance with the commitments contained in the February 22 Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the United States. The ISSG also pledged support for seeking to transform the cessation into a more comprehensive nationwide ceasefire in parallel with progress in negotiations for a political transition between the Syrian parties consistent with the Geneva Communique of June 2012, relevant UNSC Resolutions and ISSG decisions. Ensuring Humanitarian Access Since the ISSG’s last meeting, the UN, in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent, has delivered assistance to 255,000 people in besieged areas and 473,000 people in hard-to-reach areas. However, the Syrian government has yet to permit access to many locations including a number of besieged communities in Rural Damascus, in contravention of the Munich Statement. UN assessment teams, life-saving assistance, including medical supplies and personnel to ensure their proper use, have been denied to populations in need. Although some urgent medical evacuations have taken place, many cases have been delayed or denied. The members of the ISSG reaffirmed that sieges of civilian populations in Syria are a violation of International Humanitarian Law and called for the immediate lifting of all sieges. The ISSG committed to use its influence with all parties on the ground and in coordination with the United Nations to ensure immediate, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access throughout Syria, and allow humanitarian assistance to reach all people in need, particularly in all besieged and hard-to-reach areas, as defined by the UN and called for in UNSCR 2254. As called for in UNSCR 2258, border crossings that are necessary for humanitarian relief should remain open. The ISSG insisted on concrete steps to enable the provision of urgent humanitarian deliveries to the following locations: Arbeen, Darraya, Douma, East Harasta, Mouadhimiyeh, Zabadin and Zamalka. Regular humanitarian deliveries must continue, according to the UN’s monthly plans, to all other besieged and hard to reach locations, including Fouah, Kefraya, Kafr Batna, Ein Terma, Hammura, Jisrein, Madaya, Zabadani, Yarmouk. Starting June 1, if the UN is denied humanitarian access to any of the designated besieged areas, the ISSG calls on the World Food Program to immediately carry out a program for air bridges and air drops for all areas in need. The ISSG pledges to support such a program, and also calls on all parties to the cessation of hostilities to provide a secure environment for that program. Air deliveries should also continue to Dayr al-Zour. The ISSG stressed that such access, as in other areas, must be continuous for as long as humanitarian needs persist. Humanitarian access to these most urgent areas will be a first step toward full, sustained, and unimpeded access throughout the country. The Members of the ISSG look forward to seeing the UN’s June plan for priority humanitarian deliveries and urge the government to approve it swiftly and in its entirety to make up for lost time. All ISSG members commit to work together immediately with the Syrian parties to ensure no delay in the granting of approval and completion of all UN requests for access consistent with UNSCR 2254, paragraph 12. The ISSG reaffirmed that humanitarian access should not benefit any particular group over any other, but must be granted by all sides to all people in need, in full compliance with UNSCR 2254. Humanitarian aid is to be delivered based on need, for the number of beneficiaries specified by the UN, with the full package of food, medical, surgical, water, sanitation, non-food items, and any other urgently required goods as determined by the UN. The provision of mobile health services and evacuation of urgent medical cases should be facilitated by all sides based solely on urgency and need. The ISSG asked the UN to report weekly, on behalf of the Task Force, on progress on the implementation of the plan referenced above, so that in any cases where access lags or approvals are lacking, relevant ISSG members could use their influence to press the requested party or parties to provide that approval and access. The ISSG further decided that in cases where humanitarian access is systematically denied, either fully or by the denial of delivery of certain categories of humanitarian aid or disagreements over the number of beneficiaries, the ISSG, with the agreement of the co-chairs, caninform the Security Council through the UN Special Envoy for Syria. ISSG co-chairs and participants pledged to ensure that humanitarian aid convoys are used solely for humanitarian purposes. International humanitarian organizations, in particular the United Nations, will play the central role, as they engage the Syrian government, Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the opposition and local populations, in arranging the monitoring and sustained and uninterrupted distribution of aid. We encourage the international community and the UN to intensify efforts to meet the needs of internally displaced persons across Syria, without losing sight of the imperative of building conditions for the safe return of the refugees, including during the transition, in accordance with all norms of international humanitarian law and taking into account the interests of the host countries. Advancing a Political Transition the norm The ISSG reiterated the objective of meeting the target date established by UNSCR 2254 of August 1 for the parties to reach agreement on a framework for a genuine political transition, which would include a broad, inclusive, non-sectarian transitional governing body with full executive powers. In this regard, they welcomed the “Mediator’s Summary” issued after the third round of intra-Syrian talks on April 27 by UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, and endorsed in particular the “Commonalities on Political Transition” noted within the report as well as the “Fundamental Issues For a Viable Transition” contained in Annex 1 of the report that may serve as the basis for the next round of the intra-Syrian negotiations. The ISSG notes that the parties have accepted a political transition will be overseen by a transitional governing body formed on the basis of mutual consent and vested with full executive powers, to ensure continuity of governmental institutions, in accordance with UNSCR 2254. On the basis of the Geneva Communique, the ISSG urged the parties to engage constructively with the UN Special Envoy in addressing the fundamental issues for a transition, as set out by the Special Envoy. ISSG Members believe that the parties should return to negotiations on that basis at an appropriate time. All ISSG members reaffirmed that political transition in Syria must be Syrian-owned and Syrian-led, and expressed their unequivocal and united commitment to facilitating the start of political transition in Syria by consistent with resolution 2254 (2015) and previous ISSG statements of October 30 and November 14, 2015, and February 11, 2016. The ISSG also requests UN Special Envoy for Syria de Mistura to facilitate agreements between the Syrian parties for the release of detainees. The ISSG called upon any party holding detainees to protect the health and safety of those in their custody. Vienna,"
"Interview by Vygaudas Ušackas, Ambassador of the European Union to the Russian Federation, to Association of Tour Operators of Russia (ATOR)",16.05.2016,,http://www.atorus.ru/news/press-centre/new/35545.html,,"Поиск по сайту Вопросы получения виз в страны Шенгена по-прежнему остаются крайне актуальными для россиян, особенно в пиковые даты. Накануне старта летнего сезона посол  Европейского Союза в России Вигаудас Ушацкас рассказал в эксклюзивном интервью, о том, как работает новая система выдачи виз и готовы ли в ЕС облегчить для россиян визовый режим. - Прошло 9 месяцев с момента ввода биометрии. Какие основные итоги работы новой системы вы бы отметили? - Как вы знаете, процедура выдачи виз является компетенцией стран-членов Шенгенского соглашения, поэтому я ограничусь общими замечаниями. Визовая информационная система (ВИС) сейчас работает в качестве единой ""шенгенской"" визовой базы данных во всем мире. Россия была одной из последних стран, где ВИС была введена в действие. Система, начавшая свою работу в 2011 году, функционирует хорошо, и пользователи в целом ей довольны. Число заявлений на получение ""шенгенской"" визы, подаваемых во всем мире,  продолжает увеличиваться год за годом, и в 2015 достигло 15,4 млн. ВИС представляет собой техническую инфраструктуру, которая позволяет справляться с растущим числом визовых заявлений. Предположу, что если бы страны-члены Шенгенского соглашения не ввели эту систему, то было бы очень сложно – а, может, практически невозможно – справиться с этим глобальным ростом. Также отмечу, что мы видим сезонное увеличение обращений за визой, например с приближением официальных праздничных дней, когда одновременно подается много заявлений непосредственно перед праздниками. Хочу воспользоваться этой возможностью и порекомендовать путешественникам оформлять визы заранее. То же самое касается виз в Россию: я всегда советую друзьям, которые собираются приехать в Россию, обращаться за визой как можно раньше – за три месяца до даты поездки. - Хочу порекомендовать путешественникам оформлять визы заранее. То же самое касается виз в Россию: я всегда советую друзьям, которые собираются приехать в Россию, обращаться за визой как можно раньше - Сколько за истекшие полгода было выдано биометрических виз в России? Сколько всего было виз в России за 2015 год? - Сразу хочу уточнить, что биометрические данные хранятся в Визовой информационной системе, а не в визе. Именно поэтому лица, впервые обращающиеся за ""шенгенской"" визой после 15 сентября 2015 года, должны приходить лично для сдачи биометрических данных. Что касается цифр, то у нас пока нет отдельных данных по визам, выданным после внедрения ВИС в России. Если же посмотреть на статистику за весь 2015 год, то мы увидим, что в прошлом году было получено почти 3,5 млн заявлений на визу (для сравнения – в 2014 году эта цифра составила порядка  5,8 млн). Наибольшее число обращений за визой было отмечено в 2013 году – почти 7 млн. В прошлом году было получено почти 3,5 млн заявлений на визу. Для сравнения – в 2014 году эта цифра составила порядка  5,8 млн. Сокращение значительное, и объясняется оно, в первую очередь, девальвацией рубля, которая началась в 2014 году. Число подаваемых заявлений также сократилось немного благодаря тому, что у многих россиян теперь многократные визы: более половины выдаваемых ""шенгенских"" виз являются многократными. В последние годы доля выдаваемых россиянам многократных виз выросла с 40% до нынешних 68%. - Сколько в настоящее время работает визовых центров стран ЕС в РФ? Как Вы считаете, их достаточно для покрытия такой большой территории как Россия? - На основании информации, полученной от стран-членов, Европейская Комиссия публикует данные о консульском присутствии стран-членов в третьих странах, включая города, где они сотрудничают с внешними поставщиками услуг (т.е. имеют визовые центры). Стоит отметить, что ""сеть визовых центров"" в России является одной из самых крупных в мире. Решения об открытии консульств и/или визовых центров в том или ином городе принимается каждой страной-членом в отдельности. Лично я считаю, что существующие визовые центры обеспечивают довольно плотное покрытие всей территории России. Насколько мне известно, некоторые стран Шенгенского соглашения считают, что они покрывают 90%, а то и более, своих потенциальных клиентов - благодаря визовым центрам, которые расположены рядом или на доступном расстоянии от крупных городов. В общей сложности, страны Шенгенской зоны присутствуют в 59 городах России. На специальном сайте ( www.evrovisa.info ) интерактивная карта позволит путешественникам найти ближайший к ним визовый центр. - Планируется ли увеличить количество Визовых центров в России? - Как я уже отметил, страны-члены Шенгенской зоны принимают решения о расширении своего присутствия и открытии визовых центров. За прошедшее с момента начала работы в России ВИС время сеть визовых центров значительно расширилась: например, Испания в марте открыла два новых центра (дополнительный в Москве, другой в Воронеже).  Венгрия открыла более 40 визовых центров в конце прошлого – начале этого года; 8 новых визовых центров у Греции; Италия планирует открыть дополнительный визовый центр. Стремясь создать наиболее удобные условия сдачи документов на визу, некоторые посольства приняли решение открыть визовые центры, где обслуживаются только туристы, подающие документы через туроператоров. Это нововведение, такого раньше не было. Так что работа идет, мы прислушиваемся к пожеланиям как туристов, так и туроператоров. - По отзывам российских туроператоров и туристов, система ВИС оказалась далеко не столь безупречной. В частности, в Москве базы данных по биометрии визовых центров Чехии и Австрии даже спустя полгода синхронизированы, что доставляет неудобства туристам. Более того, как уже выяснилось, биометрические данные вовсе не хранятся 5 лет. Тем россиянам, которые сдавали биометрию в сентябре 2015 года и получили визу на 6 месяцев, в настоящее время снова приходится сдавать биометрию, поскольку их данные не сохранились. В чем причина таких накладок? - Что касается первой части вашего вопроса о визовых центрах Австрии и Чехии, которые якобы не синхронизированы с ВИС, то эти страны должны сами провести необходимую проверку и, если потребуется, сделать все необходимое, чтобы их визовые центры работали в должном режиме. Хотя по доступной мне информации, консульства Австрии (Москва) и Чешской Республики (Москва, Санкт-Петербург и Екатеринбург) связаны с ВИС и работают должным образом. Стоит иметь в виду, что ВИС это компьютерная инфраструктура, связывающая страны-члены Шенгенской зоны, и только консульства этих стран имеют доступ в ВИС. Большинство стран-членов Шенгенского соглашения сотрудничают с внешними поставщиками услуг, которые выполняют административные функции в рамках процедуры обращения за визой: сбор документов на визу, включая биометрические данные, передача документов и данных в консульство и выдача готовых виз. Согласно законодательству ЕС, внешние поставщики услуг не имеют доступ в ВИС. Все текстовые и биометрические данные вносятся в Визовую информационную систему консульствами. Это общее правило действует для всех стран-членов, а не только в отношении Австрии или Чехии. По второй части вопроса, скажу следующее. Законодательство ЕС позволяет странам-членам повторно брать отпечатки пальцев (до истечения пятилетнего срока), если у них возникают сомнения относительно личности заявителя, или если копирование биометрических данных технически невозможно. Ни один из названных вами аспектов не является следствием ненадлежащей работы Визовой информационной системы. По моим данным, система, в целом, функционирует хорошо. - По данным UNWTO , Европа – самый «визовый» регион мира, что сдерживает рост туристических потоков с таких крупных рынков как РФ, Китай, Индия. Нет ли в ЕС планов по упрощению визовых форматов для граждан РФ – введении электронных виз или виз по прибытию для россиян? - Прежде всего, замечу, что Россия - это Европа. Во-вторых, публикуемая ежегодно Европейской Комиссией статистика показывает постоянный рост числа обращений за ""шенгенской"" визой и выданных виз. При этом доля отказов остается крайне малой. В-третьих, планов ввести электронные визы или ""визы по прибытию"" у нас нет. - Недавно власти финского города Котка обратились в Госсовет Финляндии с просьбой ввести для круизных пассажиров, прибывающих из РФ, безвизовый формат посещения на 72 часа. Похожая идея появилась и в Эстонии. Насколько такие инициативы могут быть реализованы в принципе? Готов ли Брюссель давать «добро» на такие отдельные предложения отдельных стран? - Согласно Визовому Кодексу ЕС граждане стран, которым для въезда в страны Шенгенской зоны требуется виза, должны получать ее до совершения поездки. Законодательство ЕС не предусматривает возможности введения 72-часового безвизового режима для пассажиров круизных лайнеров вне зависимости от того, прибывают ли они из России или иной третьей страны. Хочу также обратить ваше внимание, что все решения, касающиеся Шенгенской зоны, принимаются консенсусом всеми странами-членами Шенгенского соглашения, а не неким ""Брюсселем"". - МИД РФ заявляет, что Россия готова идти на визовые послабления только при взаимном движении. В ближайшие годы вы видите основания для такого процесса? - 1 июня 2007 года вступило в действие двустороннее соглашение ЕС – Россия, которое позволило упростить процедуру получения виз для граждан ЕС, путешествующих в Российскую Федерацию, а также для граждан России, желающих совершить поездку в страны Шенгенской зоны. Было предусмотрено дальнейшее упрощение процедур, но переговоры по внесению изменений в действующее соглашение не были завершены. На данный момент все переговоры по визовым вопросам между ЕС и Российской Федерацией временно приостановлены. Если улучшится общий политический контекст, то я уверен, что переговоры по Обновленному соглашению могут быть возобновлены достаточно быстро. До ""замораживания"" визового диалога мы – и ЕС, и Россия – проделали большую совместную работу. Оставалось решить всего несколько сложных вопросов, одним из которых было требование со стороны России ввести безвизовый режим для держателей служебных паспортов (""голубые"" паспорта, выдаваемые российским правительством для совершения служебных поездок за рубеж). Несмотря на приостановку двусторонних переговоров, граждане России, как и граждане других стран мира, могут рассчитывать дальнейшие визовые послабления. Как вы помните, в 2014 году Европейская Комиссия предложила ряд мер, которые, если будут приняты странами-членами и Европейским Парламентом, позволят сделать процедуру получения ""шенгенской"" визы более гибкой. Напомню некоторые из тех предложений: увеличение максимального срока подачи документов на визу с трех до шести месяцев; возможность разрабатывать специальные схемы для выдачи на границе визы, срок действия которой не превышает 15 дней; упрощение визовой анкеты и возможность подавать заявление онлайн. В настоящее время обсуждение предложенных Европейской Комиссией мер продолжается. Поделиться Как с комфортом увидеть три экзотических страны за одну поездку?

Speech of the Ambassador - Europe Day 2016,11.05.2016,11.05.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6882_en,,"Speech by Ambassador Christian R. Manahl - Head of the EU Delegation to Eritrea Your Excellency Minister Osman Saleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Honourable Ministers, Senior Officials of the PFDJ and of the Government, Ambassadors, representatives of international agencies, Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, My wife and myself wish you a warm welcome tonight to celebrate with us Europe Day. I am grateful to the Italian Ambassador, Stefano Pontesilli, who offered us this beautiful venue in the centre of Asmara. And at the outset, I would like to thank all my colleagues who helped organize this event, which, I hope, you will enjoy. Some people told me last year that my speech was too long, but since it is only once a year that I have the occasion to talk about Europe, about the European Union, and about our cooperation with Eritrea, I will make good use of this opportunity, and so I ask you to be patient and give me some time for it. The time spent listening to me will make you appreciate the food served afterwards by Vittorio and his team. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, In a few days it will be 66 years that the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman called on the nations of Europe to unite in order to make war on our continent impossible. We consider that day, the 9th of May 1950, as the founding moment of European integration, a process that gradually, and with some ups and downs, has brought together 28 countries and more than 500 million people of different cultures, languages and beliefs into a single political entity bound by a common commitment to ""the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law"", as well as to the objectives of solidarity and the convergence of their economies, as the preamble of the Treaty of the European Union says. - 66 years which did not completely end wars on the European continent, as we have seen in the 1990ies in the Balkans, but six decades which prevented the recurrent confrontations among European powers that characterized much of the continent's history since the collapse of the Roman Empire; - 66 years which made the European Union the world's largest economy, as well as the most important trading partner for the United States, China, Russia, India, Brazil, most of Africa, and many other countries; - 66 years of an astounding recovery from the Second World War, of remarkable progress in research and development, of extra-ordinary creativity which turned Europe into a trail-blazer of technological innovation, environmental protection, climate change management, and sustainable development; - 66 years which have made Europe one of the most prosperous parts of the world, with many countries on top of the list of the most liveable places on Earth, and the world's number one tourist destination. It is worth reminding ourselves of these achievements and to remember that they are the results of hard work and of the right policy decisions, in order to put the current challenges into perspective. And challenges there are indeed, first and foremost, according to the media, the ongoing migration crisis: After centuries of sending European people off to other continents, Europe has become a major space of immigration. There are now more than 35 million migrants in the European Union, and more coming every year. While of course not all of the newcomers are refugees, the number of asylum seekers in Europe has soared in the last 3 years, reaching more than 1.3 million in 2015, and probably a few hundred thousand more who have not yet filed asylum applications. This is stretching the capacity of European societies to care for and integrate those seeking refuge, and it aggravates the risk of terrorism and other forms of international organized crime. And it's a problem which will not go away any time soon: Many countries in Europe's immediate neighbourhood, notably the Middle East and Africa, experience a dangerous combination of strong demographic growth and political instability; the ability of these countries to create sustainable and adaptable societies, to create jobs and business opportunities for their young people – or their failure to achieve this – will have a direct impact on Europe's own stability and security. I will come back to this matter in a moment, but when we lament about the migration crisis sparked off by the exodus of Syrian refugees from Turkey, let us remember where the term ""Europe, Europa"" comes from: According to Greek mythology, ""Europa"" was a Phoenician princess seduced by the Greek God Zeus, who took the form of a Bull and abducted the young lady to the Island of Crete. Which means that the first historically recorded European was an immigrant from the Middle East, and a victim of human trafficking ! It is of course a legend, but it reminds us what Europe owes to the Middle East, from the invention of agriculture and writing to the origins of Christianity, nowadays the predominant religion of Europa and an important part of its cultural heritage. The legend of Europa also reminds us of the role of ancient Greece as the cradle of European civilization, the interface between the Middle East and Neolithic Europe. Ancient Greece was an assembly of city states with an estimated total population of no more than present-day Liverpool, but it laid the foundations of modern science, mathematics, geometry, philosophy, theatre, and it had the first documented form of parliamentary democracy. Greece today is the most distressed member of the European Union because of the combined migration and financial crisis, but we should not forget that Europe would not be what it is today without classical Greece. We owe our fellow citizens from Greece the recognition of the crucial role their forefathers plaid for the emergence of modern Europe, and of modern civilization in general. Now let me turn back to European integration: The past 66 years have also created a political, economic and social space with increasing complexity; a system that has been struggling to tackle today's challenges, and this makes many people doubt about the future of this great and unprecedented political experiment which we call the European Union. Today, the citizen's confidence in the European Union is undermined by the migration crisis, by the financial crisis, by centrifugal tendencies at the continental as well as national levels. On 23rd June, the British people will decide whether they want to remain part of the Union or not, and three days later, Spain will hold elections which risk fanning the flames of secessionism in Catalonia. These are just two examples of upcoming political events that could have a profound impact on Europe's future. Whatever decisions they may bring, in my view the various challenges 5 the European Union is facing are essentially the symptom of three fundamental crises:  The first one is a crisis of confidence in our decision-making procedures. No state, no region, no political entity exists in a political vacuum, or in a world that is static. States, societies, political entities like the European Union have to face the challenges around them and within them, and adapt to an ever-changing world. The international community is a Darwinian jungle: you compete, you adapt, you innovate – or you disappear. The European Union has not been fast in tackling the migration crisis, or, to put it more bluntly, it has not been fast enough, because Member States' governments have taken things into their own hands and adopted national measures that undermine some of the fundamental principles of the European Union, notably the free movement of people and goods. If the EU wants to successfully manage the ongoing migration crisis and safeguard its own achievements, it has to invent decision-making procedures that are adapted to modern crisis situations. Collective decision-making is more democratic but it can be cumbersome, and the world around us will not wait until we have finished deliberating. We need decision-making procedures that are fast enough to solve the problems we are facing today, while securing the support of a critical mass of European citizens for the decisions that are taken.  The second crisis is a crisis of economic management and solidarity. It concerns mainly the 19 countries which have the Euro as their common currency, but it also has an impact on all the other EU Member States, as well on the rest of Europe and the wider world. I am talking of the unbearable paradox that afflicts the Eurozone: It has states which have no more control over their currency, and EU institutions with little influence on fiscal policy. This has led to serious economic imbalances between north and south, and brought some of the Eurozone members to the brink of bankruptcy. Structural efforts like the European Stability Mechanism and repeated interventions of the European Central Bank in international financial markets have so far prevented the worst, but they have not solved the fundamental problem, and worse, they have fuelled Eurosceptic sentiments in both the rich and the poor Member States. In the rich Member States, because of a growing reluctance of the public to shoulder the financial burden of others, and in the poor ones because of the dramatic rise in unemployment after 2008. The Eurozone members will have to overcome this problem and agree on an economic management system that revitalizes economic growth in all countries and brings unemployment down to reasonable levels. This is not only an issue of fiscal and monetary discipline, but also a matter of investing in the economies of the future, i.e. enabling countries to produce commodities and services that are competitive on the international market. More than ever before in recent history, Europe has to compete with new global economic powers, and it has to create an economic system that is up to the challenge, and at the same time makes the best use of Europe's talent and preserves the sense of social solidarity Europe is famous for in the rest of the world. We have to move forward economically, but without leaving some of our Member States or citizens behind.  The third crisis is a crisis of identity. Academics have often pointed out that Europe is not a political organization based on ethnic, linguistic or cultural commonality, nor on some form of supra-national ""European identity"", but on a set of common values and a common belief in the rule of law, in fair competition, transparency and accountability. This makes a lot of sense, but no political entity can survive for long without the support of its citizens, which is based on an understanding of what it is and what it wants to become. Reportedly it was Jacques Delors, one of the great Commission Presidents, who said that the European Union ""is an undefined political object"". It is an irony of history that in spite of Jacques Delors' remarkable, and remarkably successful, efforts to advance European integration, his words should sound so strangely familiar today. They sound familiar because until now, we cannot quite define what the European Union exactly is, and we do not agree what is shall be in the future. Article I of the Treaty of the European Union speaks of ""creating an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe"", but this mantra of continued integration cannot anymore be taken for granted. We should be grateful to the British Prime Minister David Cameron for having stated clearly, at the Davos World Economic Forum earlier this year, that Europe as an ""ever-deepening political union"" is ""not the right organization for us"", that is for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Cameron pointed to the elephant in the room. Do the 28 EU Member States, and their societies, still want ""an ever-closer union"" ? Do they still believe that today's and tomorrow's problems of Europe can best be solved collectively, that the EU will be able to guarantee a peaceful, prosperous and safe future for its citizens and a fair distribution of its wealth ? Not only the British electorate, but people in each and every EU Member State will have to ask themselves these questions. And if we cannot muster a critical mass responding positively, we will have to go back to the drawing board and rethink the future of the European Union, both geographically and politically. I will leave you with these observations as food for thought for the rest of the evening and beyond, and now briefly turn to Eritrea and Eritrea-EU relations. Your Excellences, ladies and gentlemen, This year is an auspicious year for Eritrea. It is of course the 25th anniversary of Eritrea's Independence, and Eritreans are truly proud of the heroic liberation struggle which they themselves, or their parents and relatives have fought. But this is also a time of new opportunities for the country: new mining businesses are opening, new cooperation agreements with international partners have been concluded, and earlier this year, Eritrea presented its submission to UNESCO for the recognition of Asmara as a World Heritage Site, which the city certainly deserves in view of its architectural treasures from the Italian Modernismo. As regards Eritrea – EU relations, they have evolved significantly over the last years. Implementation of programs under the 10th European Development Fund, mainly in the agricultural sector, but also in capacity building for the administration and the judiciary, is in its final stages. With the 11th European Development Fund, our cooperation will reach another dimension. At the end of January, the Minister of National Development, Dr. Giorgis Teklemichael, and myself signed the new National Indicative Program, which is the framework for the next half-decade up to 2020. It expands considerably the financial scope of our cooperation but also gives it a new orientation, focusing on renewable energy and governance. In the first sector, the EU will support Eritrea's energy shift from hydrocarbon-based sources to solar, wind and geothermal energy, of which Eritrea has a considerable potential. In the area of governance, we agreed to work together on the implementation of the recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review on human rights, and support the Government's efforts in economic planning, statistics, and public finance management. We look forward to working with the government, but also with other institutions which have an important role like the National Confederation of Eritrean Workers or the Chamber of Commerce, in order to help create an environment that stimulates growth and employment creation, leading eventually to a balanced, robust economy capable of competing on the international market while ensuring the basic needs of the population and equal opportunities for all. We believe, indeed, that a strong, dynamic economy is the key to resolving one of the problems that affects both Eritrea and the EU, albeit in different ways – namely migration. We are trying to tackle this collectively in the context of the Khartoum process and the follow-up to last November's Valletta conference. Some of the EU Member States are also actively involved: Finland has been supporting higher education, whereas Italy and Germany have decided to resume bilateral cooperation and are discussing with the government potential sectors and activities. We understand that education and training are a priority for the government, and we maintain our offer to this sector, as well as for other activities addressing the root causes of migration, through the Trust Fund created at Valletta. However, education and training have to go hand in hand with the creation of conditions for a dynamic labour market and a favourable business environment. Otherwise, upgrading the skills of young people without offering them opportunities for employment or entrepreneurship will only encourage emigration, rather than reducing it. Finally, whenever I touch this topic, I have to point out that migration is not just a problem but also an opportunity. Eritrea has a formidable Diaspora in neighbouring countries and in Europe, with valuable skills, experience and in some cases capital, and most of them maintain strong links to their homeland. Encouraging them to come back and participate in the development of the country could help unlock the untapped economic potential of Eritrea. We expect, of course, that many of them will come in the course of this months to celebrate with us the Silver Jubilee, for which I would already congratulate our Eritrean friends in advance, and offer a toast to the government and the people of Eritrea, and to the cooperation between Eritrea and the European Union ! Thank you. Asmara"
"Speech by Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič on ""Nord Stream II – Energy Union at the crossroads""",10.05.2016,10.05.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6650_en,,"On 6 April, Vice-President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič participated in the conference ""Nord Stream II – Energy Union at the crossroads"" at the European Parliament. On 6 April, Vice-President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič participated in the conference ""Nord Stream II – Energy Union at the crossroads"" at the European Parliament. In his speech he said: ""Mr President, Honourable Members of the European Parliament, Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for having invited me to give some introductory remarks at today's conference ""Nord Stream II – Energy Union at the crossroads"". In May 2014, the European Commission set out in its Energy Security Strategy how the EU remains vulnerable to external energy shocks. It called on policy makers at national and EU level to diversify and reduce our dependency on particular fuels, energy suppliers and routes. The Energy Union builds on this strategy. Energy security, solidarity and trust constitute a key dimension of our framework strategy of 25 February 2015. The key drivers of energy security remain the completion of the internal energy market and more efficient energy consumption. But events over the past years have also shown that diversification of energy sources, suppliers and routes are crucial for ensuring secure and resilient energy supplies to European citizens and companies. More transparency and solidarity between the Member States are equally important. At the same time, the EU's energy security is closely linked with its neighbours. It is in this spirit, that on 16 February of this year, the European Commission presented its Security of Supply Package , which responded to many calls of this house. I believe that this package sends a strong signal that we are building a secure and resilient Energy Union, based on competition and cooperation for the benefit of EU citizens and companies. Let me just recall that the package proposes a revised Security of Gas Supply Regulation, an LNG and storage strategy, changes to the scrutiny of Intergovernmental Agreements in the field of energy to make sure they are in line both with European law and security of supply objectives, and a Heating and Cooling strategy to moderate demand, which also contributes to enhancing energy security. Now this package is in the hands of the two co-legislators. I am confident that its final form will send a strong signal that the EU is determined to building a competitive and resilient Energy Union. It is precisely in this context that we have to see Nord Stream 2 , which is the main theme of today's meeting. I know that it is a subject of huge interest, sometimes concern of many in this house but also to Member States as was reflected in the recent letter of 9 Prime Ministers addressed to President Juncker. The concerns are of various nature, be it legal, geopolitical or economic. We have taken note of the plans of gas undertakings to build Nord Stream 2. If built, Nord Stream 2 would have to fully comply, as any other infrastructure project, with applicable EU law , including on energy and environment. Let me underline again that EU law applies in principle also to off-shore infrastructure under the jurisdiction of Member States including their exclusive economic zones. What exactly within EU sectorial legislation applies has to be assessed in regard to their specific provisions. The construction of such an important infrastructure project as Nord Stream 2 cannot happen in a legal void. This would also run counter to the interest of economic operators in having legal certainty. Neither can it be exclusively operated only according to Russian law. Against the background of colliding legal regimes, Nord Stream 2, if built, has to be operated under a legal framework which also takes duly account of the key principles of our energy market rules. Regarding the environmental aspect , let me stress that energy infrastructure needs to comply with EU environmental legislation. All energy infrastructure can face disruption, or even catastrophic interruption. Just think about the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which taught us that dramatically. Germany has exemplary rules for the operation of pipelines connected to Norway. These rules not only fully respect the 3rd energy package, but also, regarding the environment, set out the rules for operation, maintenance and environmental monitoring of the three pipelines leading from Norway to Germany. These rules are set down in legally binding agreements between the countries; agreements the Commission has examined, so that we are in a position to praise the transparency and firmness of these rules. There are also other good examples. As regards the operational safety aspects of the Nord Stream pipeline, these could have significant effects on human health. They are therefore to be assessed under the relevant national safety and environmental legislation (such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive). We will urge the Member States to clarify issues of environmental liability; in this context, the Commission is currently reviewing the situation at all sub-sea entry points into the EU, and will assess what further action may be needed. And regarding the onshore section of Nord Stream 2, whatever its route on EU territory, the rules of the Third Energy Package must be duly respected and the Commission will ensure their correct application. But let me be very clear: the impact of the Nord Stream 2 project goes clearly beyond the legal discussions . Nord Stream 2 could alter the landscape of the EU's gas market while not giving access to a new source of supply or a new supplier, and further increasing excess capacity from Russia to the EU. This raises concerns, and I am pretty sure this will play a role in this debate. Regarding the Energy Union objectives, as I said publicly before, the EU will only financially support infrastructure projects that are in line with the core principles of the Energy Union, including the EU Energy Security Strategy. Diversification of energy sources, suppliers and routes is crucial for ensuring secure and resilient supplies to European citizens and companies. Nord Stream 2, as presented so far, does not meet these conditions. As regards security of supply , Nord Stream 2 could lead to decreasing gas transportation corridors from three to at least two – abandoning the route through Ukraine. Also the Yamal route via Poland could be endangered. Such a reduction of routes would not improve security of supply. Just today, the European Commission adopted a joint framework on countering hybrid threats. Critical infrastructure such as energy networks are highlighted in this policy paper as potential targets. Our diversification strategy has to be seen also in this light, if we want to build a resilient and secure Energy Union. Let me say here a few words on Ukraine : Despite economic and political challenges, Ukraine continues to be a reliable gas partner and transit country. It is in the interest of all parties that Ukraine remains a significant gas transit corridor. The successful implementation of the gas winter package, with the constructive engagement of both Russia and Ukraine and facilitated by the European Commission, has helped to secure domestic consumption in Ukraine and contributed to smooth transit supply of Russian gas to the EU. The European Commission stands ready to continue the successfully proven format and to enlarge the trilateral talks to the negotiation of a new transit contract between Russia and Ukraine, as the current one comes to an end in 2019. To this end, the completion of energy sector reforms in Ukraine are of utmost importance and should be further implemented. There is no better reassurance for Ukraine to remain a transit country and to attract investors to its gas assets then by completing ownership unbundling of Naftogaz and setting up an independent energy regulator in line with the 3rd Energy Package. Ukraine has all our support to make these necessary game-changing steps. Regarding the market impact of the Nord Stream 2 project, we are carefully analyzing what impact it can have on our ever more competitive gas markets. We have made a lot of progress in implementing the Third Energy Package across Europe and we have to make sure that no market operator is able to leverage its dominant position to the detriment of consumers. To this end, our LNG strategy aims at ensuring that all Member States have access to liquid LNG markets which are a competitive alternative to other suppliers. To conclude , let me thank President Buzek and his colleagues for organizing this important conference. I feel very much encouraged by the excellent co-operation with and huge support by the European Parliament on the building of the Energy Union. We fully agree together that all energy projects must be fully aligned with the EU's core policy objectives, including energy security. In the end, we should not look in an isolated way on infrastructure projects. We have to find comprehensive and well balanced solutions, benefitting all Member States alike, as well as our neighbours and trading partners. In this context, we have to have a frank and objective discussion about how much gas do we really need in the future in the post-CoP21 context and against the background of the 2030 climate and energy framework. We have our own projections but to enlarge the debate, we have also approached IEA and ENTSO-G who are ready to contribute to such modeling. This would also help to better assess, what are the most cost-efficient routes really needed. We are today at a crossroad. I am convinced that together we will succeed in achieving the goals of a resilient Energy Union with an ambitious climate policy, that is to give to our citizens secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy. Thank you very much for your attention."" Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the presentation of the integrated EU policy for the Arctic,27.04.2016,27.04.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5093_en,,"Check against delivery! Today, we had different points on the agenda of the College. The reason why Karmenu and myself are here is to present to you the Joint Communication we just adopted on the EU policy for the Arctic. And I think it is probably the mix of the weather in Brussels and the fact that you have probably the three most Southerners of the Commission presenting the Arctic Joint Communication - a good sign of the fact that this is not only a matter for some of the Member States or for parts of our policies, but a priority for the whole of the European Union. We had a very good discussion and conversation with Paavo Lipponen, former Finnish Prime Minister and also contributor to our debates with a paper, and also highlighting the fact that Finland is going to take the Chair of the Arctic Council next year. We developed today, we adopted today, an integrated EU policy on the Arctic. I know you will have plenty of questions on other things – from Turkey to whatever – but still, let me say, before I turn to Karmenu and let him articulate more on the details of the environmental part of the Communication, that the EU work on the Arctic is consistent, dates back several years now, but what we have adopted today is an integrated approach: so putting together all different programmes, all different policies from the environmental to the maritime one; but also the scientific, technological one and touching on all the different aspects for which the Arctic is essential to the Europeans and what the Europeans can do for improving the conditions in the Arctic in three main pillars. One is obviously the climate change-related one and the environmental one. Just a few days ago we were all signing the Paris Agreement in New York on climate change. You know the European Union was key in achieving the climate change Agreement last December. We are committed to the full implementation of it. And our work on the Arctic is an important part of how we face the challenge of climate change and we avoid major catastrophes for the entire world. The second pillar of our Arctic policy is on the economic and social dimension, making sure that the development of the Arctic, which has a huge economic potential is done in a sustainable way and that there is a social part to it especially looking at the conditions of the indigenous peoples and the need to assure that the development of the region is taken in a sustainable way. But also, third pillar of our integrated policy, is the fact that the Arctic is a key strategic region for our Foreign and Security Policy. It is the only place in the world where three continents and major players in the world meet, be it Russia, the United States, Canada, several EU Member States, several European countries that are not members of the European Union, but with which we work a lot. It is a region of the world where we have a good example of a constructive, cooperative, regional and international approach. And it is a key interest of the European Union and of the European citizens to make sure that the constructive international cooperation there is maintained and even increased and that the European Union is part of that. So we will continue to work with all relevant players, engaging with each of them, meaning all the countries that have territories in the Arctic, but also all other global players that have increased interest in the Arctic, such as China for instance or other Asian actors, including also the potential of connectivity through the Arctic of different routes. So, touching on many different aspects, the Joint Communication identifies 39 actions, focusing on key areas – again I will let Karmenu go more in detail about that. We also decided to continue to work, as we have done so far, very closely together with him, with also Carlos Moedas, with other Commissioners, on the implementation of the Joint Communication. Obviously we will ask the Council and the Parliament their views on it, and we will make sure that we proceed fast and well on this. Because again – working on the Arctic is an investment not only for the 4 million people living there, but also for the whole of Europe. Let me mention – before I conclude and give the floor to Karmenu – that we also had in the College a debrief from First Vice-President Timmermans on his visit to Turkey during the week-end. We also shared the state of play of the implementation of the EU-Turkey plan, including regarding the assessment that is ongoing of Turkey's compliance with the benchmarks for visa liberalisation. This will be an issue on which we will focus next week. So we will for sure come back to that in 7 days. We also had, during the same time, Vice-President Katainen, together with Commissioners Moscovici, Hahn and yourself, Karmenu, launching the first ever High-Level Economic Dialogue with Turkey – extremely important to discuss with Turkey also non-migration related issues. So we had also a conversation and a debrief about that, as well as we will have another High-Level Political Dialogue with Turkey in the coming weeks here in Brussels. I will stop here. Bruxelles"

"G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, 10-11 April 2016 in Japan – extracts of the Joint Communiqué",12.04.2016,12.04.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6665_en,,"The Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the High Representative of the European Union, gathered in Hiroshima, Japan on 10 – 11 April to address a number of major international issues that impact global peace, security and prosperity. The Ministers adopted the Joint Communiqué and endorsed the Statement of the G7 Non-Proliferation Directors Group on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament as well as the Statement on Maritime Security. The G7 Japan Joint  Communiqué covers a number of international issues such as countering terrorism and violent extremism, Syria, refugees, irregular migrants and internally displaced persons, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Afghanistan, Middle East Peace Process, Yemen, Africa, climate change and security, human rights, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, anti-corruption, counter-narcotics and others. Among other issues, the G7 Joint Communiqué also touches on the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia. To this end, it says, in particular: ""We stand united in our conviction that the conflict in Ukraine can only be solved by diplomatic means and in full respect for international law, especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We reiterate our condemnation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in violation of international law and reaffirm our policy of its non-recognition and sanctions against those involved. We emphasize our strongest support for full implementation of the Minsk agreements, and the work of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, which are aimed at securing peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We are concerned by continued violence along the line of contact in violation of the ceasefire; we urge all sides to take concrete steps that will lead to the complete ceasefire required under the Minsk agreements. We reiterate our call on all sides to assume their responsibilities fully and completely fulfil their commitments under the Minsk agreements without delay, including local elections held in accordance with relevant Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) standards and Ukrainian legislation and monitored by OSCE/ODHIR, the complete withdrawal of all foreign armed formations and equipment from the territory of Ukraine, the return of Ukrainian control over its side of the international border, and safe access and provision of humanitarian aid to people in need. In particular, we expect Russia to live up to its commitments and use its influence over the separatists to meet their commitments under the Minsk agreements in full. We emphasize the OSCE's key role in helping to deescalate the crisis through the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) as well as the Observer Mission and within the Trilateral Contact Group and commend the OSCE for its constructive response to the Minsk agreements. We deplore actions that impede the OSCE's work and access and call upon all sides, particularly the separatist groups to provide the organization's monitors full and unfettered access throughout the conflict zone. In this regard, we call on Russia to use its influence to provide for the necessary environment for OSCE/SMM to effectively carry out its task. We call on all OSCE participating states to provide the organization with all support necessary to fulfil these responsibilities in order that such actions cease. We recall that the duration of sanctions is clearly linked to Russia's complete implementation of the Minsk agreements and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty. We recognize the importance of maintaining dialogue with Russia in order to ensure it abides by the commitments it has made as well as international law and to reach a comprehensive, sustainable and peaceful solution to the crisis. Furthermore, we remain concerned by the ongoing disinformation campaigns in the Russian state-controlled media as well as the growing pressure on political and civil society figures voicing disagreement with the course being taken by the Russian government. We remain fully committed to Ukraine's reform agenda, and to providing long-term support to this end. We commend and support the steps Ukraine is taking to implement comprehensive structural reforms and urge Ukraine to maintain the momentum and continue to take the difficult decisions, especially in the fight against corruption where concrete progress is required. We will continue to work together with the international financial institutions and other partners to provide financial and technical assistance. A stable political situation in Kyiv is key to those essential reforms. We welcome the ongoing efforts of the G7 Ukraine Support Group and ask the G7 Ambassadors in Kyiv to continue the platform for dialogue and coordination between G7 countries and the Ukrainian authorities. Energy security remains an important issue for Ukraine and the world. We remain committed to the Rome G7 Energy Initiative for Energy Security to build a more diverse and resilient international energy system.""

"G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting April 10-11, 2016 Hiroshima, Japan Joint Communiqué",11.04.2016,11.04.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5310_en,,"Preamble We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the High Representative of the European Union, have gathered in Hiroshima, Japan on April 10-11 to address a number of major international issues that impact global peace, security and prosperity. The G7 shares common values and principles, including democracy, respect for the rule of law, free, fair and open markets, respect for territorial integrity, and respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. We are united in standing together to meet challenges to the universal values that we share and the rules-based international order that we cherish and benefit from. We are determined to employ coordinated efforts and action to tackle global challenges including terrorism and violent extremism, political instability as well as new types of security threats or non-traditional threats. We endorse the Statement of the G7 Non-Proliferation Directors Group on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament as well as the Statement on Maritime Security.  Regions and the World Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism We strongly condemn the attacks, atrocities and abuses of human rights, including sexual violence, abductions of women and children for sexual and other exploitation, and the murder of civilians, including hostages perpetrated by ISIL/Da'esh as well as other terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda. Blatant abuse of human rights and the destruction and disorder being brought about by ISIL/Da'esh and other terrorist organizations continue to pose a serious threat to local, national, regional, and international peace and security, as illustrated by recent terrorist attacks. We condemn the recent attacks in Turkey, Belgium, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire and Pakistan. We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of terrorist attacks everywhere and their families. Countering terrorism and violent extremism and bringing perpetrators to justice remain top priorities for the whole international community. As we witness the spread of radicalization to violence in the world, we stand united in our efforts to counter terrorism in all its forms and wherever it occurs. Terrorism is an urgent global security threat that requires international collaboration and unified responses. We welcome the continued efforts of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL/Da'esh, dismantle its networks, and irrefutably deny its global ambitions. We strongly support the Coalition's resolve to intensify and accelerate the campaign against ISIL/Da'esh in Iraq and Syria and to bolster humanitarian assistance for those affected by ISIL/Da'esh and affiliated groups. In response to the current threat level, we are working on a G7 action plan on countering terrorism that will include concrete measures to enhance G7 and international counter terrorism efforts, to be adopted at the G7 Ise-Shima Summit in May. We will continue to enhance our coordination to support countries in need of building their capacity to improve information sharing on known and suspected terrorists, and to improve border and transport security to eliminate safe havens for terrorist organizations and individuals. We will continue to work together to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and terrorism-related goods, as well as the financing of terrorist organizations. To this end, we also stress the importance of action-oriented cooperation among judicial and law enforcement institutions within a rule of law framework based on respect for human rights. We stress the importance of building partnership and trust between law enforcement institutions and the communities they protect, including through appropriate reform of investigation, detention, prosecution, and sentencing practices. In particular, we support the goals set out in the Rabat Memorandum on Good Practices for Effective Counterterrorism Practice in the Criminal Justice Sector and the development of effective justice sector Central Authorities to facilitate the sharing of information. We are committed to achieving improved global aviation security and will continue to work closely with partners and through international organizations towards that goal. At the same time, we acknowledge the useful efforts by the G7 Roma-Lyon Group in promoting cooperation among the G7 countries, including by considering actions to bolster the use of Passenger Name Records and Advance Passenger Information systems consistent with UN Security Council resolution 2178. In that regard, we express our support for INTERPOL's Action Plan announced at the September 2015 Leaders' Summit on Countering ISIL and Violent Extremism, and undertake to consider how we can help other countries enhance their connectivity between National Central Bureaus and points of entry. We also express support for International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s Traveler Identification Program (TRIP) and efforts to deter the use of fraudulent travel documents, as well as the World Customs Organization's Security Program and its capacity building initiatives for border security. Furthermore, we reaffirm the importance of the work underway by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to counter terrorist financing through the effective implementation of FATF standards. We also welcome the approach by the international community to bolster our collective efforts in peace and security, sustainable development, human rights, rule of law and humanitarian action to address the underlying conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and violent extremism, including through economic, social, and educational aspects, to address the political and economic grievances that may be drivers of violent extremism and to promote respect for human rights. In this context, we welcome the ""All-of-UN"" and ""whole-of-society"" approaches and recommendation that Member States adopt their own strategies for preventing and countering violent extremism as set forth in the UN Secretary General's Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism and the UN General Assembly resolution 70/254 recognizing that violent extremism undermines the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We will in particular work together to improve our collective understanding of the drivers of violent extremism and radicalization to violence, and of the most effective efforts to address these. We call for the full implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 2178, 2199 and 2253 to fight this threat. The G7 will continue to make coordinated efforts towards this end, being mindful of the synergy created among our individual efforts. We note the emphasis given in the Plan of Action to education and tolerance and welcome the G7 Education Ministers' intention to discuss this. We emphasize the importance of promoting pluralism, moderation, tolerance, and gender equality, as well as cross-cultural, cross-religious, and interfaith dialogues, and promoting freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief as useful tools to prevent and counter violent extremism and terrorism. We stand against the destruction of cultural heritage by terrorist groups and the pillage and smuggling of antiquities. We call on private and public actors involved to take all appropriate measures to prevent such smuggling. We also stress the importance of tackling corruption, at all levels of government and in the private sector. Corrupt practices perpetuate the underdevelopment of minority and other vulnerable communities and support the narrative of marginalization used by violent extremists in their recruitment efforts. We are also reminded of the threat posed by the use of the internet and Social Networking Services (SNSs) by terrorists for terrorist or violent extremist purposes and other criminal purposes such as terrorist recruiting, finance, attack planning and coordination. Therefore, we emphasize the need for continued cooperation with the private sector, civil society and communities in investigating, disrupting and prosecuting terrorists' illegal activities online while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression and the privacy of those who use the internet for peaceful activity, including to express political dissent. We also seek continued cooperation with the private sector, civil society and communities to address terrorist and violent extremist propaganda by empowering credible voices to counter these messages with positive alternatives. The G7 will continue to make coordinated efforts towards this end. Syria We welcome the efforts taken by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) for lasting peace and stability of Syria, including the Cessation of Hostilities that came into force on February 27, 2016. It is vital that all parties to the Cessation, as well as their backers, continue to observe its terms fully and focus negotiations on political transition away from Assad's rule, in line with UN Security Council resolution 2254. Syria desperately needs a new government, representative of all Syria's communities and able to protect its people, fight terrorism and rebuild Syria. We urge all members of the international community to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions 2254 and 2268, including rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access by all sides to all people in need throughout Syria, and to commit to an inclusive and peaceful political transition through intra-Syrian negotiations facilitated by the UN and based on the Geneva Communiqué. We reiterate our support to the High Negotiations Committee. We express our grave concern at the continued suffering of the Syrian people and the dire humanitarian situation in Syria and call upon the regime and its backers to release all arbitrarily detained persons, including women and children, and to comply with international humanitarian law and human rights obligations and to avoid harm to civilians and to civilian infrastructure in the conflict. We reiterate our strong commitment to supporting the resilience of the Syrian refugees and internally displaced persons, and their host communities inside and outside Syria, and to working towards a long-term, sustainable post-conflict stabilization and rehabilitation of Syria. We welcome the renewal of the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry. We call on the international community to promptly disburse financial commitments made at the ""Supporting Syria and the Region London 2016"" Conference. We express grave concern over the findings of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) that chemical weapons continued to be used throughout 2015 in Syria, and we stress the importance of identifying and holding accountable those responsible. We were further concerned that the OPCW Executive Council had found there to be a number of unresolved gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in respect of Syria's chemical weapons declarations, which must be addressed. We also express grave concern that, despite the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors resolution of 9 June 2011, which reported Syria's non-compliance with its Safeguards Agreement to the Security Council and General Assembly of the United Nations, Syria has yet to remedy this non-compliance. Refugees, Irregular Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) With the flow of refugees, irregular migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs), at the highest level since the Second World War, the G7 places the highest priority on addressing the challenges of and managing successfully this global crisis and its humanitarian consequences. Such a situation entails suffering, abuse and exploitation, particularly for children and women, and unacceptable loss of life in the desert or at sea. It also places the most affected countries under severe pressure. It requires a decisive response by the international community and to manage migration flows in all their aspects, in full respect for human rights and international obligations. Displacement is a multi-faceted phenomenon, which requires addressing its root causes resulting from conflicts, state fragility and insecurity, as well as demographic, economic and environmental trends. The international community should therefore increase its efforts towards conflict prevention, stabilization, and post-conflict peacebuilding and focus on finding solutions in order to reduce poverty, promote peace, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights, support inclusive economic growth and improve the delivery of basic services. In line with the new approach to protracted crises announced at the ""Supporting Syria and the Region London 2016"" Conference, we urgently call on all members of the international community to strengthen their commitments to protect and assist refugees, and IDPs, as well as to build capacity and enhance resilience in communities, and support the initiatives of relevant international organizations. We applaud the recent International Dialogue Global Meeting in Stockholm which reconfirmed our commitments to Sustainable Development Goals 16 and the principles of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, and look forward to the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May, and the relevant high level events at the UN General Assembly in September. We will also strengthen efforts to fight against smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons, in partnership with countries of origin, transit and destination, and to this end, we call for the implementation of the relevant international conventions, in particular the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols against Smuggling of Migrants and against Trafficking in Persons. Iraq We commit our continued support for the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. We commend Iraqi forces' efforts in their fight against ISIL/Da'esh. We recognize their bravery and sacrifice in freeing 40% of the territory ISIL/Da'esh controlled in 2014 with the continued support of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. We support Prime Minister al-Abadi and his government's efforts to continue and accelerate reforms in order to enhance the participation of all Iraqis regardless of their origin or beliefs through national reconciliation and inclusive governance. We welcome their commitment to improve the human rights situation, investigate all allegations of abuses and violations and hold those responsible to account, and reiterate the importance of full respect for international humanitarian law. We also welcome Iraq's continued commitment to implement its National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. We stress the need to rebuild inclusive and government controlled Iraqi forces and underline that all armed groups must be under the command and control of the Iraqi state. We note with grave concern the allegations of manufacture and use of chemical weapons by ISIL/Da'esh in Iraq, welcome investigations by the government of Iraq and express our commitment to working, with and through the OPCW to mitigate extremely serious threats to regional and international security. We remain concerned by the humanitarian situation, including more than 3.4 million IDPs, and call on donor countries to continue responding to the crisis by extending humanitarian assistance country-wide to reach people in need. We also call on partners to support Iraq's stabilization efforts in areas liberated from ISIL/Da'esh, in close cooperation with the Iraqi authorities, the UN and other international organizations. We commit to support Iraq's efforts to address its fiscal challenges. We also call on Iraq to move forward in implementing a program of significant economic reforms to directly address fiscal vulnerabilities and to help facilitate access to further international financial support. We recognize that the triple shock of low oil prices, the fight against ISIL/Da'esh, and the humanitarian crisis has resulted in dire economic challenges for Iraq including in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and poses a threat to Iraq's ability to fight against ISIL/Da'esh and to its reconstruction and assistance efforts to IDPs and refugees. The G7 affirms our commitment to work together, including with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the international financial institutions, to provide and expedite financing for Iraq as appropriate, in support of its economic reform program and efforts to directly address fiscal vulnerabilities. It is critical that all Iraqis, including in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, benefit from this support. Iran We welcome the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The G7 will continue to actively support its full and effective implementation, including activities of the IAEA which is responsible for monitoring and verifying Iran's nuclear-related commitments. We call upon all UN member states to effectively implement measures required by the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2231 and to consider making voluntary contributions to support the IAEA's efforts. The implementation of the JCPOA has created the opportunity for a new relationship between Iran and the international community. We thus regret Iran's decision to proceed with the testing of ballistic missiles inconsistent with UN Security Council resolution 2231. We call on Iran to play a constructive role in its region by contributing to the efforts to achieve political solutions, reconciliation and peace in Syria, Iraq and Yemen and other parts of the region, and cooperate to prevent and counter the spread of terrorism and violent extremism. We also call on Iran to comply with its international human rights obligations, including by respecting freedom of expression, including for members of the press, freedom of religion or belief and other human rights, and end arbitrary executions carried out in violation of its international obligations. North Korea We condemn in the strongest terms the nuclear test on January 6 and the launch using ballistic missile technology on February 7, and subsequent ballistic missile launches conducted by North Korea. These repeated provocations not only undermine regional stability, but also pose grave threats to international peace and security, and are clear violations of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. We demand North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology, nor engage in any other destabilizing or provocative actions. We welcome the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2270 and renew our strong demand for North Korea to immediately and fully comply with all relevant UN Security Council resolutions as well as its commitments in the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks of 19 September 2005, and abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear and ballistic missile programs, including its uranium enrichment and plutonium production programs, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. We also call on the international community to fully implement and enforce relevant UN Security Council resolutions, in particular, UN Security Council resolution 2270, to respond to the clear and continuing threat to international peace and security posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. We deplore the ongoing systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations in North Korea as documented in the 2014 Report of the UN Commission of Inquiry. We strongly urge North Korea to immediately address the international community's humanitarian and human rights concerns, including the abductions issue. In this regard, we welcome the adoption of the Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at the 31 st Session of the UN Human Rights Council, underscoring the importance of continuing to work towards accountability, and active discussions on the ""Situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)"" at the UN Security Council. Ukraine / Russia We stand united in our conviction that the conflict in Ukraine can only be solved by diplomatic means and in full respect for international law, especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We reiterate our condemnation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in violation of international law and reaffirm our policy of its non-recognition and sanctions against those involved. We emphasize our strongest support for full implementation of the Minsk agreements, and the work of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, which are aimed at securing peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We are concerned by continued violence along the line of contact in violation of the ceasefire; we urge all sides to take concrete steps that will lead to the complete ceasefire required under the Minsk agreements. We reiterate our call on all sides to assume their responsibilities fully and completely fulfill their commitments under the Minsk agreements without delay, including local elections held in accordance with relevant Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) standards and Ukrainian legislation and monitored by OSCE/ODHIR, the complete withdrawal of all foreign armed formations and equipment from the territory of Ukraine, the return of Ukrainian control over its side of the international border, and safe access and provision of humanitarian aid to people in need. In particular, we expect Russia to live up to its commitments and use its influence over the separatists to meet their commitments under the Minsk agreements in full. We emphasize the OSCE's key role in helping to deescalate the crisis through the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) as well as the Observer Mission and within the Trilateral Contact Group and commend the OSCE for its constructive response to the Minsk agreements. We deplore actions that impede the OSCE's work and access and call upon all sides, particularly the separatist groups to provide the organization's monitors full and unfettered access throughout the conflict zone. In this regard, we call on Russia to use its influence to provide for the necessary environment for OSCE/SMM to effectively carry out its task. We call on all OSCE participating states to provide the organization with all support necessary to fulfill these responsibilities in order that such actions cease. We recall that the duration of sanctions is clearly linked to Russia's complete implementation of the Minsk agreements and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty. We recognize the importance of maintaining dialogue with Russia in order to ensure it abides by the commitments it has made as well as international law and to reach a comprehensive, sustainable and peaceful solution to the crisis. Furthermore, we remain concerned by the ongoing disinformation campaigns in the Russian state-controlled media as well as the growing pressure on political and civil society figures voicing disagreement with the course being taken by the Russian government. We remain fully committed to Ukraine's reform agenda, and to providing long-term support to this end. We commend and support the steps Ukraine is taking to implement comprehensive structural reforms and urge Ukraine to maintain the momentum and continue to take the difficult decisions, especially in the fight against corruption where concrete progress is required. We will continue to work together with the international financial institutions and other partners to provide financial and technical assistance. A stable political situation in Kyiv is key to those essential reforms. We welcome the ongoing efforts of the G7 Ukraine Support Group and ask the G7 Ambassadors in Kyiv to continue the platform for dialogue and coordination between G7 countries and the Ukrainian authorities. Energy security remains an important issue for Ukraine and the world. We remain committed to the Rome G7 Energy Initiative for Energy Security to build a more diverse and resilient international energy system. Libya We welcome the Government of National Accord's (GNA) move to Tripoli and will work closely with this government as the sole legitimate government of Libya. We also call on Libyan leaders to seize the opportunity and work together to support the GNA, which is accountable to the Libyan people. We call on all member states to cease all contact with parallel and defunct institutions, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 2259. We express our full support to United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General Kobler's efforts to facilitate the full implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement as signed in Skhirat on December 17 2015. At the same time, we remain deeply concerned about the growing terrorist threat, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, humanitarian suffering, targeting of human rights defenders and humanitarian workers, and the depletion of state assets. We also call on all Libyan parties to ensure access and security for humanitarian organizations to improve their response to the needs on the ground. The international community stands ready to provide a significant package of support to the GNA and the people of Libya in order to facilitate the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement, to build effective state institutions, including security forces, to restore public services, to alleviate humanitarian suffering, to expand infrastructure and diversify the economy, to manage migration flows, and to eradicate the terrorist threat and criminal networks. We stress that it is essential that the remaining chemical weapons precursors in Libya be urgently destroyed. More widely, we welcome cooperation to combat the illicit transfer of conventional arms, in particular in the Sahel region. Afghanistan We stand firm in our commitment to Afghanistan and its people and welcome the continuation of the NATO-led international engagement in the train, advise and assist mission to strengthen the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). We remain concerned by the continuing threat to security and stability in Afghanistan, and strongly support international efforts, especially by the Quadrilateral Coordination Group to facilitate a process of peace and to promote reconciliation between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban and other groups. We remain steadfast in our support of the government of Afghanistan as it undertakes reforms towards good governance, strengthening electoral systems, sustainable development, the effective delivery of basic services, measures on anti-corruption and counter-narcotics, as well as promoting respect for rule of law and human rights, in particular the rights of women. In this context, we welcome the recent renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) by the UN Security Council. We look forward to the NATO Warsaw Summit in July 2016, as well as the ministerial conference on Afghanistan to be held in Brussels in October 2016, which will be important opportunities to renew security and development assistance commitments to Afghanistan. Continuous security, political, financial and development support is essential in order to build on and consolidate the progress that has been achieved in Afghanistan. Sustained international support will require continued concrete progress by the government of Afghanistan on its reform commitments. Middle East Peace Process Achieving Middle East peace remains a key priority and an indispensable element for regional security. We urge both sides to avoid steps which could spark further escalation, including unilateral measures which could prejudge the outcome of negotiations and threaten the viability of the two-state solution. We call upon the parties, with the active support of the international community to work towards a negotiated solution based on two States living in peace and security. We commend international efforts to that end. Yemen We are concerned about the ongoing conflict in Yemen. We welcome the cessation of hostilities on the Saudi-Yemeni border and the announcement by the UN Special Envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, that the parties have agreed to a cessation of hostilities on April 10 and to peace talks in Kuwait beginning April 18. We reiterate his announcement by calling on all actors to work toward a cessation of hostilities and engage constructively in an inclusive, peaceful political solution consistent with UN Security Council resolution 2216. We underline the importance of rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all regions of the country and for all groups of society, in order to alleviate the dire humanitarian situation for the Yemeni people, and we call upon those on all sides of the conflict to avoid harm to civilians. We reiterate our strong support for the UN Special Envoy in his efforts to end the violence in Yemen and bring all parties back to the negotiating table so the country can resume its political transition, based on UN Security Council resolution 2216 and other relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Deauville Partnership We reiterate our commitment to the implementation of the Deauville Partnership, in order to address the political, economic and social challenges faced by the Arab countries in transition (ACTs). We remain committed to supporting ACTs in order to foster sound financial and economic evolution through long term structural reforms and improved governance in support of economic development and stability and democratization. We reaffirm the role of civil society in accomplishing this. Africa We are convinced that stability, security, good governance and economic opportunity are the foundation of prosperity and thus support efforts made to counter terrorism and violent extremism, prevent and resolve conflicts, and promote sustainable development and resilience in Africa. We recall the need to address both the immediate and the root causes of current challenges, especially of radicalization leading to violence. We welcome progress on economic growth and the strengthening of democratic institutions in Africa as exemplified by the peaceful elections held recently in a number of countries, including the successful conclusion of the transition in Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic. Regarding upcoming elections in several African countries, we call on those states to ensure free, fair and credible elections in accordance with their constitutions. At the same time, we recognize the need for further progress in these areas, in the face of global economic challenges, high population growth, and continued governance challenges in many countries. We reiterate our commitment to invest in our bilateral and multilateral partnerships with African countries to support peace and sustainable development across Africa based on their ownership through implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as through the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), the EU-Africa partnership and the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. To this end, we will continue our support for African partners, including the African Union and the relevant sub-regional organizations, in addressing challenges in the areas of security, governance, stability, economic management and development in the continent, including countries like Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions.  Global Issues Cyber Issues Stressing the importance of open, free and secure cyberspace and the promotion and protection of human rights online as well as offline, we reiterate the importance of the free flow of information and oppose excessive restrictions or unjustified control over the free flow of information. We recognize that states have particular responsibilities and roles in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environment, just as elsewhere to promote security, stability, and prosperity. We reaffirm our commitment to a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance, which includes full and active participation by governments, private sector, civil society, the technical community, and international organizations, among others. We commit to utilizing ICTs in addressing global issues and achieving progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We share concerns about the malicious use of cyberspace, including by state-sponsored actors and non-state actors. We stress that existing international law, including the United Nations Charter, is applicable in cyberspace. We welcome the report of the fourth UN Group of Governmental Experts, call upon all states to be guided by the assessments and recommendations of the report and look forward to the establishment of the fifth UN Group of Governmental Experts. We encourage all states to join the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. We reaffirm our support for the importance of the work done by the G7 Roma-Lyon Group's High-Tech Crime Subgroup and its 24/7 Network. We commit to strengthening our cooperation in promoting the rule of law in cyberspace, capacity building, confidence building, and the fight against cybercrime. Space Outer space activities have immense potential for the social, economic, scientific and technological development of all states, and for tackling global issues. We remain concerned about the development of anti-satellite capabilities. We are committed to enhancing the long-term safety, security, sustainability and stability of the space environment, to increasing transparency in space activities, and to strengthening norms of responsible behavior for all outer space activities. Climate Change and Security We welcome the adoption of the Paris Agreement by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21). We also commend the leadership demonstrated by the government of France. We encourage Parties, particularly the major emitters to sign and ratify, accept or approve the Paris Agreement as soon as possible, thereby facilitating its prompt entry into force. We will actively and constructively engage in efforts to develop and adopt rules and guidelines for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. We welcome the decision in Dubai by the Montreal Protocol parties to work to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the Montreal Protocol, and support adoption of a Montreal Protocol HFC phase-down amendment in 2016, and intend to provide additional support through the Multilateral Fund following adoption of an amendment for its implementation. We reiterate that climate change poses a serious threat to global security and economic prosperity and shared the view that foreign policy must contribute to addressing this challenge effectively. In this context, we welcome the report submitted to us by the G7 Working Group on Climate Change and Fragility, endorse its recommendations, and affirm the need to continue to work on the issue of the climate-fragility risks. We will work to prioritize prevention of climate fragility risks by aligning our efforts toward the common goal of increasing resilience and reducing fragility in the face of global climate change, including taking steps to integrate climate-fragility considerations across our national governments. Human Rights We affirm our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. We hold that human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that pluralism is not a threat, but rather a source of strength in our societies. We recall that compliance with obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law is a cornerstone for peace and security. We note that increasingly, human rights defenders are targeted and harassed for daring to speak out against human rights abuses and violations, or even to simply document them. We are also concerned by the increasing restrictions imposed on political activity, press freedom and civil society space, both formal and informal, by governments in many parts of the world. We will work towards ensuring the safety of human rights defenders and of civil society more broadly and toward supporting the vital network of human rights and civil society organizations despite the increasing restrictions being placed on them. Women, Peace and Security and Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict We are appalled by the prevalence of gender based violence, including sexual violence, against women and girls in conflict situations as well as during and in the aftermath of natural disasters, including concerning rates of child, early and forced marriage, and reaffirm the recently published G7 Report on the Implementation of the G8 Declaration on the Prevention of Sexual Violence in Conflict. In these contexts, we reaffirm the importance of tackling sexual violence, supporting victims while holding perpetrators to account. We note that sexual violence affects not only women and girls, but also men and boys. Victims from all gender and age groups must be acknowledged and supported. While promoting the human rights of women, their empowerment as well as gender equality, we reaffirm the importance of women's active and meaningful participation in the whole process of conflict prevention and resolution, mediation, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction, and recognize the role of women as strong agents for reconciliation and community resilience. In this context, and particularly with respect to the situations highlighted above, we welcome the ongoing efforts by the international community to promote equal participation of women in the maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace and security, as well as in our fights against terrorism and violent extremism. We welcome the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2242 and efforts through conferences such as the World's Assembly for Women. We call upon all states to implement the commitments they made at last year's UN Security Council High Level Review of resolution 1325 to ensure implementation of this critical agenda. Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding We support the ongoing reform process on UN peace operations and peacebuilding, and call for further efforts among the member states, UN system and relevant international and regional partners to improve respective approaches to prevent, mitigate and resolve conflicts, to protect civilians in conflicts, and to consolidate peace and stability of the countries and regions concerned. We welcome the pledges of additional contributions to UN peacekeeping made at the Leaders' Summit on Peacekeeping and urge their timely implementation. In this context, we welcome our Experts' work in order to better coordinate bilateral and multilateral cooperation for capacity building to African countries and beyond, and to promote a new approach of triangular partnership among the UN, troop contributing countries (TCCs) and third countries. We call on all states to support and comply fully with the Secretary General's zero tolerance policy towards sexual exploitation and abuse including by implementing the measures requested in UN Security Council resolution 2272. Anti-Corruption Tackling corruption is vital for economic growth, maintaining our security, poverty reduction, protecting the environment for our children, and addressing the long-standing economic grievances that may fuel violent extremism. We support the major anti-corruption summit hosted by the UK on May 12, which will, in conjunction with the work done within the G7, the G20, the Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption, the OECD Ministerial on the Anti-Bribery Convention and other relevant international fora, help to galvanize action against corruption, and set priorities for the international community over the next 3 to 5 years. The summit will bring together leaders and heads of major international organizations pivotal to the global anti-corruption architecture to focus on implementing the international community's commitments to tackle corruption. Counter-Narcotics We express our grave concern about the damages caused by the world drug problem on the health and welfare of humanity, development, stability and regional and international security, including the threat posed by New Psychoactive Substances. We commend the work of G7 partners which address the trans-regional nature of drug-trafficking, including the EU's Cocaine Route and Heroine Programs as well as numerous programs aimed at prevention, early identification, treatment and care, and social reintegration. In this context, we emphasize that the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem that will take place in New York on April 19-21, is a crucial step in the definition, development and implementation of concrete, operational and evidence-based solutions and urge all members of the international community to work together in developing and implementing such integrated and balanced drug policies in the framework of the existing conventions. Global Health and Global Health Security The public health emergencies caused by the Ebola and Zika viruses underscore the human and economic losses caused by infectious diseases. We reaffirm the role of foreign policy in promoting sustainable and resilient health systems and global achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goal 3, including universal health coverage. We remain committed to assist the implementation of the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (2005), in cooperation with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), using common and measurable targets to achieve national capacity to prepare for, prevent, detect, notify, and respond to health emergencies and biological threats, whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental, including through various initiatives, such as the Global Health Security Agenda. We also remain committed to the replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and assisting Ebola affected countries recovering from the devastating impacts of the epidemic while strengthening the capacities of their health systems. We recognize that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a grave threat to human life, and commit to a One Health approach to tackle it. We intend to take further action in the G20 and UN General Assembly this year, building on the commitments of the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR. We reiterate our commitment to the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, and welcome its work, in particular, to strengthen capacities against biological threats.

Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the sentencing of Nadiya Savchenko,23.03.2016,23.03.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2951_en,,"Despite many calls, Ukranian pilot Nadiya Savchenko has been sentenced yesterday. We continue to add our voices to the many others worldwide calling on the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Nadiya Savchenko, on humanitarian grounds, and in keeping with the ""Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements"" and the commitment therein to release all hostages and detained persons related to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. This is also the case for all the other Ukrainian citizens illegally detained in Russia, including Oleh Sentsov and Oleksandr Kolchenko, that need to be guaranteed a safe return to Ukraine.

Relations with Russia: EU's guiding principles,15.03.2016,15.03.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/59532_en,,"On 14 March, the Foreign Affairs Council, among other issues, took stock of EU-Russia relations. The ministers unanimously supported five principles guiding the EU's policy towards Russia. Speaking at the press conference following the Council Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, said in particular: ""We had a very positive work session on Russia with the ministers, not focusing on sanctions for once, but on our bilateral common policy of EU-Russia relations. We will come back to the sanctions decisions in due time, either at the Foreign Affairs Council and/or at the European Council. Let me stress that we had, among the 28, unanimity on five guiding principles of the European Union's policy towards Russia: The first of these guiding principles is the full implementation of the Minsk agreements as a key element for any substantial change in our relations. By the way, this is an important week, it is the week where two years ago the illegal annexation of Crimea took place and we re-stated our common strong position of non-recognition of the annexation of Crimea. The second principle is strengthening relations with our Eastern Partners and other neighbours, in particular in Central Asia, and we had very good discussions on how to proceed in this respect. Third , strengthening internal European Union resilience, in particular in view of energy security, hybrid threats and strategic communication, but not only. Fourth principle we all agreed on is the need for selective engagement with Russia, both on foreign policy issues – this is clear, when it comes to Iran or the Middle East Peace Process or Syria, but also DPRK, migration or counter-terrorism, climate change – but also in other areas where there is a clear European Union's interest. The fifth of our guiding principles is the willingness to support more and more the Russian civil society and engage and invest in people-to-people contacts and exchanges and policies that are related to that, with a particular view to the youth of Russia and the youth of the European Union because we see the future of our countries as something we need to invest into. This, as I said, was not a difficult discussion. We had a very much united discussion and I believe this is going to be extremely relevant for the follow-up of our work. Obviously we will follow this up and in particular the Commission will have in the coming months also discussion on that part of the work, which will be framed by the political decisions or conversations we had today with the Ministers.""

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,14.03.2016,14.03.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5490_en,,"Apologies for the delay, it has been a long Council. We discussed many different and important things. Let me say that it was also a very good Council, extremely constructive and representing very much united positions of the Member States on all the issues we discussed. Let me start from Libya. We had a long discussion with Martin Kobler, the UN Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General. After the Libyan political dialogue meeting in Tunis, just a couple of days ago, we were deeply briefed by Kobler on the results and on the procedures of the Libyan political dialogue's work. We welcomed the results, especially like they were represented in a statement that they produced, in all their parts. We see very clearly the need for Libya to have a Government of National Accord as soon as possible to be able to tackle both the security and the humanitarian situation of the country, but also the risk that, first of all for the Libyans, is in the absence of a government. We are ready as European Union, together with the rest of the international community, to encourage and support in all possible ways the Libyans work in this respect and we have also started our internal work to sanction individuals who are obstructing this internal Libyan process. We had a very positive work session on Russia with the ministers, not focusing on sanctions for once, but on our bilateral common policy of EU-Russia relations. We will come back to the sanctions decisions in due time, either at the Foreign Affairs Council and/or at the European Council. Let me stress that we had, among the 28, unanimity on five guiding principles of the European Union's policy towards Russia: The first of these guiding principles is the full implementation of the Minsk agreements as a key element for any substantial change in our relations.

Third, strengthening internal European Union resilience, in particular in view of energy security, hybrid threats and strategic communication, but not only. Fourth principle we all agreed on is the need for selective engagement with Russia, both on foreign policy issues - this is clear, when it comes to Iran or the Middle East Peace Process or Syria, but also DPRK, migration or counter-terrorism, climate change - but also in other areas where there is a clear European Union's interest. The fifth of our guiding principles is the willingness to support more and more the Russian civil society and engage and invest in people-to-people contacts and exchanges and policies that are related to that, with a particular view to the youth of Russia and the youth of the European Union because we see the future of our countries as something we need to invest into. This, as I said, was not a difficult discussion. We had a very much united discussion and I believe this is going to be extremely relevant for the follow-up of our work. Obviously we will follow this up and in particular the Commission will have in the coming months also discussion on that part of the work, which will be framed by the political decisions or conversations we had today with the Ministers. On Iran, I shared with the Ministers our plans. First of all I gave an assessment of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which is on good track. The IAEA also recently confirmed that Iran is sticking to its commitments. We exchanged and shared an assessment following the elections in Iran. That was a clear vote of confidence in President Rohani's agenda especially on economic reforms. And I shared with the Ministers plans and preparation of my visit  on the 16 April with a number of Commissioners, in particular Commissioner Cañete, for energy and Climate, Commissioner Moedas,  for research, Commissioner Vella for environment, Commissioner Bieńkowska, for enterprises, Commissioner Stylianides, for humanitarian affairs, Commissioner Navracsics, for education and Commissioner Bulc, for transport. This outlines already the different elements and different issues we are going to cover in our dialogue with our Iranian counterparts. We will have political consultations, including consultations on human rights, but also dialogue and cooperation on trade and investment, on energy, including oil and gas, renewables and energy efficiency, and also civil nuclear cooperation that is something that comes out of the JCPOA as a natural field of engagement for the European Union. In the field of transport, it will cover in particular the work that we can commonly do on aviation safety. We also discussed about the need for a dedicated dialogue on migration with Iran, the fight against drugs, the field of research, education, science and environment and obviously the regional issues that are going to be always on our agenda with Iran. We also had a last point but not least - on the Middle East Peace Process. I updated the ministers on the state of play of the work of the Quartet in producing the report we agreed to do in Munich, during the meeting with the Principals - with US Security of State Kerry, Minister Lavrov, the UN Deputy Secretary General - and the synergies and coordination we are establishing with a French initiative that is taking shape in these days; our Special Envoys are in contact. The French minister Jean-Marc Ayrault presented ideas and all Member States welcomed this approach of creating synergies and working together in support of the consolidated European position and in strong connection with the Quartet members and with the Arab interlocutors that are also those with whom we are working in the framework of the Quartet. Let me also mention that I updated the Ministers on the external work on migration we have been doing in this month and that will be the basis also of my report to the European Council later this week.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council,14.03.2016,14.03.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5487_en,,"Let me start by saying that our thoughts this morning will be first of all with the victims  of the attacks both in Ivory Coast and in Ankara, and I am sure we will come back to that at the European Council that will take place later this week on Thursday and Friday. Today on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council we have first and foremost Libya. We will host the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy Martin Kobler. We will have with him an exchange of views on how to proceed. We had also talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday about that in Paris. It will be important for us to find the ways to deliver our European Union's support in all possible fields, starting from the humanitarian one to the Libyan people. We also have Russia on the agenda. It's more than one year that we did not have EU-Russia relations on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers. It is not going to be a discussion on sanctions that were rolled over just a few days ago; and we will come back to the economic sanctions only later during the summer at the European Council. What we will discuss with the Ministers today will be the state of play of our relations with Russia. A common definition, a united definition of what are the guiding principles of our bilateral relations with Russia, of the European Union and Member States together. I will tell you more after the discussion. We will also have a point on Iran ahead of my next visit that will take place on 16 April, together with many other Commissioners. We will discuss with the ministers on which ground and on which issues or sectors to re-engage, to re-open full relations and exploring ways to cooperate with Iran bilaterally and also obviously a little bit of the regional dimension. Syria is also a point very high on our agenda, but also Yemen and other issues. And last but not least on the Middle East Peace Process. You know that we are working hard in the Quartet and with our international partners starting from the Arab countries to try and keep the perspective of the two states for Israel and Palestine alive and to build the roads that can lead there. The situation is definitely not improving on the ground. We had, even today, very sad news. So it is very important that the Europeans bring this issue forward together with our partners in the international community and we will have I think a very good productive discussion about that with Member States. Thank you. Q: On the Middle East and the French-led initiative. We are working very well together. We had exchanges with the French Minister and also with the French Special Envoy on the Middle East who you know very well, Pierre Vimont, and who is someone who knows very well the European institutions and has a habit to work within the European Union dimension. We are working very well together with our French friends. When I say Europeans have to work together, together also with the international partners, I mean this - we need to create synergies between different tracks that are possible.  Our objective is the same, our coordination is full and good so today we will have another chance of strengthening this unity at the European level.

Statement by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini calling for the release of Nadiya Savchenko,09.03.2016,09.03.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2835_en,,"I have been following with the utmost personal attention the case of Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko since the very beginning. This is no longer just a judicial or political case: now it's a matter of human compassion. Her health condition is deteriorating rapidly and we all fear terrible consequences. Her release would be in line with Russia’s international human rights commitments as well as with the ‘Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements’ and the commitment therein to release all hostages and detained persons related to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. For these reasons, I call on the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Ms Savchenko on humanitarian grounds. Bruxelles"
Statement by the Spokesperson on the situation of Nadiya Savchenko,03.03.2016,03.03.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2836_en,,"Reports on Nadiya Savchenko's hunger and thirst strike are extremely worrisome. The European Union continues to call for Nadiya Savchenko's immediate release. This would also be in keeping with the ""Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements"" and the commitments therein to release all hostages and illegally detained persons related to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The European Union underlines, as it has done on previous occasions, that Russia bears responsibility for the health, well-being and observance of the human rights of all persons it detains Bruxelles"
"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the Joint Press Conference with the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan, Elmar Mammadyarov",29.02.2016,29.02.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5335_en,,"Baku, Azerbaijan, 29 February 2016 Check against delivery! Thank you very much, Elmar. Let me say that my first visit to Azerbaijan comes, as you said, at a very important moment in our relationship. We just had an open and very good discussion, not only with you but also with the President [Ilham Aliyev] today. We exchanged views on a range of issues and also talked a lot about the future direction of our important relationship that we both consider as key. We didn't only discuss about things, but we also decided a certain number of steps on which our teams are going to follow-up on both sides. I will not mention them one by one, also not to spoil the news once we start to work concretely on them, but the number of fields on which we decided to follow-up our meetings today is relevant and consistent and allows me to say that the visit has been extremely productive. Now we have to make sure that the follow-up is productive as well. We are looking, as you mentioned, to upgrade our relations and develop them to their full potential through a new bilateral agreement. I can announce that consultations for such an agreement have started with a view to the upcoming discussions with the EU Member States on a mandate for such agreement. We share a difficult, challenging - sometimes promising, in any case complex - region, where Azerbaijan plays a key role, in particular given its borders with Turkey, Russia, Iran among others. We share an interest in the regional cooperation and we have discussed at length - both with the Foreign Minister and with the President - the current geopolitical challenges we face and the perspectives for cooperation in this respect that we both consider key. We also spoke of the role that Azerbaijan plays as a bridge between cultures, a contribution that is particularly welcome and recognised in view of the challenges that we are facing in our common region and inside our societies as such. I'm very pleased that Baku will be hosting the 7th Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations on 25-27 April. I'm also sure that Azerbaijan's contribution to the dialogue of cultures will be reflected in our future agreement because we believe that the experience and the nature of Azerbaijani society in this can be extremely valuable for Europe and for all. Azerbaijan has also the potential to become one of the EU's major commercial partners in the region. The European Union is already Azerbaijan's main trading partner and one of the most important investors, and we work to expand these commercial ties in the near future. In particular, Azerbaijan is a strategic partner with regard to European energy security. The Southern Gas Corridor plays a key role in EU's strategy to diversify our energy supply sources and transportation routes; Azerbaijan is crucial for the development of this project. The Southern Gas Corridor was defined as a key priority in the Council Conclusions, so by the European Council of Foreign Ministers, on energy diplomacy adopted last July, which confirmed that the European Union's foreign policy would give particular priority to partners and initiatives that are crucial for better diversification of the EU energy sources. This, as I mentioned this afternoon, is not only something that is relevant for the EU Member States that participate in the project, but for the European Union as such. Today, I've addressed - together with President Aliyev and Commissioner Šefčovič - the Southern Corridor Advisory Council, an initiative to which - as the European Union - we attach a great value. It's more that energy diversification and EU energy security for us. And I would like to thank Azerbaijan for having arranged and hosted this Second meeting of the Advisory Council. For us, this is also about enlarging and deepening political, economic and social ties with all the partners involved in the project and building on a better regional connection. Our commitment to implement the Southern Gas Corridor continues to be of utmost importance for the EU-Azerbaijan dialogue. But the European Union and Azerbaijan now also want to move forward in many different other areas of cooperation, working together as partners – as strong partners. Today, we also discussed the ongoing economic situation, the need to adjust the Azerbaijani economy to the new reality of lower oil prices and slower regional growth, and the work undertaken by the authorities here in this respect. And we agreed on some further elements of cooperation in this respect that we will try to put in place as soon as possible. Moving forward in the WTO negotiations would be beneficial in this process, paving the way for an open and competitive business environment and further economic integration between the European Union and Azerbaijan. We agreed in general terms to strengthen our cooperation on the economic reforms that the authorities of Azerbaijan are putting in place to diversify the economy. I stressed during our talks the high importance that the European Union attaches to the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and association. Indeed, dialogue, understanding and peaceful engagement among different points of view is as important in relations between cultures as it is within them, and within our own societies. This is the story of the European Union. The European Union itself is firmly based on the notion that an open society is the best guarantee for long-term stability and prosperity, and we stress this point in our relations with all our close partners. In our discussion today, I invited the authorities to establish a new relationship of trust between the government and civil society at large, and in this context I also referred to a number of individuals presently in jail. Tomorrow I will meet with representatives of civil society. We agreed that the Eastern Partnership remains the framework, the policy framework for our relationship. As you might know, the European Union has recently reviewed our Neighbourhood Policy, which has a special focus on the principle of differentiation, meaning that we recognise different situations, different agendas, different priorities, and we try to have tailor-made approaches to that. And I believe that the on-going consultations for a new agreement, a new bilateral agreement between Azerbaijan and the European Union are exactly a proof of this new approach. As stated also by President Tusk during his visit last July, the EU supports the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. The European Union and its Member States have not recognised Nagorno-Karabakh. The status quo, we believe, is unsustainable and the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains for us a top priority. We continue to support the mediation efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The European Union calls for the intensification of high-level talks towards peace. The conflict does not have a military solution and needs a political settlement in accordance with international law. It is also important for us to create an enabling environment, in particular by refraining from actions on the ground and confrontational rhetoric that heighten tensions and undermine the peace process. The European Union supports the OSCE proposal aimed at creating an incident investigation mechanism, and we talked with the Minister at length about that, also in detailed terms, and I appreciate that very much. The European Union will continue to bolster the efforts towards peace including through our Special Representative Herbert Salber, who was joining me during the meetings today, and is currently and always working on this for us. The European Union is always and also ready to further support peacebuilding activities and people-to-people contacts across the conflict divide. All that we can do in this respect, we will. Finally, let me add that we had excellent exchanges today, but we need to continue. So it is my pleasure to invite the Minister to come to Brussels as soon as we find a suitable date, so that we can continue our work on the future of our relations and on the present of the steps we can take to build them even stronger.

Statement by the HR/VP Federica Mogherini on cessation of hostilities in Syria,23.02.2016,23.02.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2925_en,,"The agreement announced by the US and Russia, as co-chairs of the ceasefire task force established by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), of which the EU is part, on the terms of a nationwide cessation of hostilities in Syria is good news and a step in the right direction.  It is fully in line with the decision taken by the ISSG in Munich last week. It is now crucial to work on the concrete implementation of modalities.  It must apply to all parties currently engaged in military or paramilitary hostilities, other than groups designated as terrorist organisations by the United Nations Security Council, as also emphasized by the European Council on 19th February Our duty is now to work with all relevant actors to accept the modalities for cessation of hostilities and to honour the commitments they made in Munich last 11-12th February. Syrians have already seen the first signs that the diplomatic talks can deliver for them with the relief of besieged areas with convoys of humanitarian aid. The delivery of humanitarian aid and the respect of the cessation of hostilities would enable UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura to reconvene the intra-Syrian talks in Geneva. The EU as a member of the ISSG is working hard to support the UN Special Envoy and the Syrian parties in implementation of UNSCR 2254. All members of the ISSG have the responsibility to live up to their commitments to implement the UNSCR 2254. After 5 years of conflict, we appeal to all not to waste this opportunity to put an end to the war in Syria and unite forces to fight against Daesh. Bruxelles"
Doorstep remarks of High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council,15.02.2016,15.02.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5281_en,,"Brussels, 15 February 2016 Check against delivery! Good morning. Let me start with two good news. The first one is that we will receive just now the membership application from Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is something on which the Bosnian authorities together with us have worked very hard and I believe this is a moment that is going to be important for all the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also for the European Union. In the moment where the European Union is questioned from within, it is still very attractive from the outside. This is a sense of energy and a positive sign that we welcome very much. The second good news comes from Libya where this night the Presidency Council adopted a list of ministers. We met the President of the House of Representatives just two days ago in Munich, discussing modalities and timing of the endorsement of the Government by the House of Representatives. I hope that Libya can have a fully operational government in place very soon. In the Council today we will have as a point of discussion with the Ministers Syria obviously. We will report back from the International [Syria] Support Group we had in Munich a few days ago. Only a few days ago all the actors around the table, from the region and internationally, adopted decisions on cease-fire, on the cessation of hostilities, on the modalities for doing that. We expect that all parties stick to that commitment and make it possible on the ground to have the cessation of hostilities, starting from Aleppo, and access for humanitarian aid.  We will discuss the European Union role in this respect, that is mainly working together with the UN on the ground to deliver humanitarian aid to the population that is in need. We will host the Foreign Minister of Lebanon to discuss this and other regional and bilateral issues we have in common. We will also have as points on the agenda Belarus and Moldova - with complicated but important political developments - and a point with Commissioner Cañete on climate diplomacy. This is something we have to follow-up after the Paris success. The climate change conference gives us a big responsibility as Europeans to follow-up and make sure that COP22 is also going to be a success and that decisions are going to be implemented. So a full agenda and I will see you in the afternoon to report to you on the decisions Ministers have made. Q. On the announcement made by Turkey and Saudi Arabia that they could intervene in Syria. A. As I said, only a few days ago, all of us, including Turkey, sitting around the table decided on steps to de-escalate and have a cessation of hostilities. We discussed concrete modalities for doing that. Having on the ground trends that go in the opposite direction obviously is not what we expect. Q. Russia mentioned to be in a new Cold war with the West what does it mean for the EU? I have not seen a climate of Cold War in these last days. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I116455 Q: On Bosnia and Herzegovina Indeed, today we have good news. Because the fact that we will receive now the membership application is something good. I believe something good for the Bosnian people, something on which the authorities have been working hard. I know something on which the civil society has high expectations. We have as well. It is not the end of the process, on the contrary, it is the beginning of a new phase - which, I have to say, also the European Union has to celebrate. Because in the moment when the European Union is questioned from within, saying that in our immediate neighbourhood there is such energy, willingness to join and to work hard to adapt the country, society, economy, institutions, system to European standards, it is the sense of responsibility we have also towards our European Union citizenship. It is a huge, marvellous project - our European integration - and news like this one of this morning remind us all of how lucky we are that we are living in a continent that is able to bring peace and the ability to live one next to another in peace and cooperation, together. Q: On the credibility of the application submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today we will receive it. Obviously, Member States will look at it, also the European Commission. As I said it is a process that starts, but think of where we were one year ago. I remember that in December 2014, just one month after taking office, I visited Sarajevo together with Commissioner Hahn. We were there several times after that and at that time any possibility to get to this morning was completely out of the radar . I believe that a lot of steps have been made. Again, a lot still needs to be done as we always say. In this case this is true. But if I Iook at the commitment, the public support that has been there in this year to get to this point, I am confident that also the next steps can be done with the same sense of responsibility and commitment by all in Bosnia and Herzegovina and also in our side.

Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the alignment of certain countries concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine,04.02.2016,,http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/04-hr-alignment-restrictive-measures-russia/,,
Remarks by HRVP Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,18.01.2016,18.01.2016,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5174_en,,"Brussels, 18 January 2016  Check against delivery!  The Council took a little bit longer than foreseen - as is the case almost every time - but it was extremely good and fruitful in its results. It started with a point that was not on the agenda, but I felt it was an absolute priority to update and brief the Ministers on the Implementation Day of the Iranian nuclear deal. We shared the assessment of the fact that this is indeed a turning point, not only for security and stability in the region, but it also opens new ways for bilateral cooperation. In this respect I shared with the Ministers the plans that we are preparing ahead of a visit that I will lead hopefully during the Spring to Tehran with members and Vice-Presidents of the [European] Commission, covering the different aspects of our possible cooperation with Iran and to study in detail with our counterparts what fields of practical cooperation we can explore, obviously after they have had elections.  We also adopted two Council Conclusions. One on Libya: you know very well that these are crucial hours; you also know that I met not only the Prime Minister designate but also all members of the Presidency Council just ten days ago. We started discussing priorities in the European Union’s support to the future Government of National Accord. We expressed our common hope that this will come into effect soon, hopefully in the next hours, and we also shared unanimously the priorities for the European Union’s support to the future government: to focus on support to the municipalities, also counting on the huge network of European municipalities and local authorities that Europe has - in coordination also with the Committee of the Regions; and on border management:  that is another field that the European Union has a lot of competences, capacities and also means. But also other issues, including the security sector reforms that we will be ready to explore with the Libyan authorities once they are in place.  We also adopted unanimously Council Conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process. You will see the text, which is a good and common basis for our common position, for our engagement in the Middle East Peace Process with the parties on the ground, but also with the international actors and the regional partners, in particular the Arab countries and the three ones that have already been working with us in this respect. There is also a reference to working with them on the Arab Peace Initiative and in the Quartet, obviously.  The whole morning was dedicated to our discussion on Syria and Iraq and the regional developments that we have seen in the beginning of the year, especially with rising tensions between Saudi-Arabia and Iran after the executions that were carried out in Riyadh and the reactions in Iran. We shared the common goal of all Europeans to invite all in the region to calm the rhetoric and actions, to de-escalate the tensions and in particular to protect the fragile but very important process that we all started just a few months ago in order to bring to an end to the Syrian conflict with the Vienna talks. This includes the successful meeting we had in December in New York of the International Support Group, where both Iran and Saudi-Arabia were sitting, which was supported and endorsed by a Security Council Resolution that was adopted unanimously. That is the track that needs to be followed. The political talks among the Syrian parties in Geneva has to start. We have unanimously shared the priorities for us, as the European Union, in coordination with the Member States, to actively support the work of the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura who I met just a few days ago here in Brussels when I also met the opposition representatives who will participate in the talks.  Apart from that, let me also say that we focussed very much our attention on the humanitarian situation on the ground. Because we have to make sure that as we invest politically in the political process to start, the situation on the ground improves rather than becomes worse, which is sometimes what we see happening. That is why we have decided to focus on the confidence building measures, the humanitarian access, and we have unanimously condemned all attacks on civilians, especially those that are happening in these delicate moments where we are trying to begin the talks. It is very important that the political process starts, in parallel with some improvement on the ground, otherwise the credibility of the whole process, and somehow the resilience of the whole process risk to be undermined.  We had a very important exchange with the Jordanian Foreign Minister, who I also had the chance of meeting yesterday to prepare today's meeting. Jordan is one of the most, if not the most, relevant partners in a very turbulent region - an island of stability as they defined themselves - and we all agree inside the European Union that we need to invest in the resilience and the stability of Jordan. Because our job is not only to manage the crisis, but also to invest in the countries that are showing an enormous amount of resilience and stability in difficult times. We have discussed with him the regional development, the work we commonly do in Syria, and also on the Middle East Peace Process and on other issues in the region, but also our common work in the fight against Da’esh and radicalisation, and obviously also the issue of the refugees crisis that they are facing much more than we are.  We have prepared together the London Conference which will take place on 4 February. It will not only be a donors conference but also a political conference with the the Heads of State and Governments together with, on the European side, President Tusk and myself. It will constitute, I believe, a very important contribution to the stability and the management of the crisis inside Syria and around.  Last but not at all least, we had  a discussion on Ukraine, restating our full and united support to the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements but focusing this time, maybe for the first time in this clear and focused way, not only and not so much on the Minsk implementation  but on the reform process inside Ukraine and especially the reform of the judiciary, the reform of the public administration sector, the decentralisation reforms and recognising the incredible, outstanding work that the Ukrainian authorities have done over the past months to move forward the reform agenda with very concrete steps.  We shared also the assessment that this works needs to continue, especially with the provisional application of DCFTA since 1 January, that the need for us to support the Ukrainian authorities in a better coordinated way between the European Union and Member States to make sure that the reform agenda continues, especially that it is implemented, and that the benefits of the reform agenda manage to reach the Ukrainian people, who just two years ago, exactly two years ago, were in Maidan asking for reforms and changes in their society. So, time for the agenda to deliver - in very difficult circumstances - but this is exactly the meaning of our engagement  with Ukraine to support and to sustain in I hope, I believe, an effective way.  Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I114991 Q: On Syria, Geneva Conference and the HRVP's meetings with Riad Hijab and his delegation and with Mr de Mistura. A: Let me first of all thank Saudi Arabia for the work they have done in putting together the conference in Riyadh in December and facilitating this difficult work. They were asked to do this by the International Support Group for Syria and I think they have managed to come with a process and with a result that is much more inclusive than expected in the beginning. Having said that, there is a discussion within the International Support Group on how to coordinate the outcome of the Riyadh conference with the role that Staffan de Mistura has and has to keep, of leading the game in Geneva when the talks hopefully start. Obviously, it is the UN through Staffan de Mistura that has the responsibility of issuing the invitations and organising the way in which he believes that talks can be fruitful. I do not know about the timing but today the Security Council is meeting with Staffan de Mistura to share different assessments on this. I would obviously not take the place of the UN Special Envoy. This is his role, his responsibility. For us it is important that the outcome of the Riyadh conference is adequately taken into consideration - as it was a breakthrough - in bringing the unity to the opposition present at the conference. Also making sure that all the members of the International Support Group feel comfortable with more than the composition, but with the management of the talks that still have to be organised and this is not the responsibility for the European Union but of the United Nations. What I can say is that our role is to support in very concrete terms, i.e. politically, logistically, diplomatically the work of the Special Envoy of the United Nation and also to support the opposition in their preparation in for the talks. We have discussed both with the opposition and Staffan de Mistura concrete ways with which the European Union and the Member States can coordinate efforts in this respect. But the decision on how to organise the talks in Geneva is a matter for Staffan de Mistura who is currently discussing with the Security Council, as far as I know.  Q: On the EU visit to Iran and on Ukraine. A: I started by saying that we were all united in applauding and encouraging the outstanding work that the Ukrainian authorities have done in the past months in order to introduce and start implementing reforms, so there is no doubt in this respect. This does not mean that we should not look at ways to first of all, encourage, support and sustain the reforms inside Ukraine from a social, financial, and a political point of view, without substituting the Ukrainian authorities, the government, the President, the Parliament, the local authorities or the political system. We must actively support this process because I think we have learnt from the past from the present. Once you start a process there is never enough, you also need to continue focusing on how you can better make it sustainable internally, externally and in the region. There is not at all a shift of focus: we have always said and continue to say that the Minsk Agreements need to be fully implemented by all sides. As you very well know, the decision by the Council last December to roll-over the sanctions against Russia for another six months was a clear sign of this continued commitment, of which there is no doubt. On Iran: The plan to visit Iran is at a very advanced stage of planning. We don't have a date fixed yet but we discussed it both within the [European] Commission, in the College and in the Commissioners’ Group that I coordinate every month to start preparing sectors of engagement between the European Union and Iran where we believe there could be open channels that could be mutually beneficial. We have also started to discuss this with our European counterparts, at my level with Minister Zarif in Vienna a few days ago, starting to define possible time and possible scope. Our visit will be prepared by a political dialogue not at my level but at political directors’ level. So the main point is: Implementation Day is a turning point first and foremost because after having the agreement we also managed to implement it. This shows that diplomacy works and delivers. Second, because it opens the way for different kind of bilateral relations. In the region hopefully; with other actors as we have seen on Saturday with the release of prisoners – it is always good when bilateral relations can be facilitated by multilateral talks and processes, even if it was two separate processes. Third: this opens the way for major European Union investment in our bilateral relations that we will need to explore in details with the Iranian authorities to make sure that this covers their interest, our interests and that we coordinate well among Europeans.  Q: Sono giorni abbastanza tesi per quanto riguarda i rapporti fra Roma e Bruxelles. Le ultime parlano di dichiarazioni arrivate da fonti europee, su la difficoltà di trovare interlocutori validi nel governo di Roma per quanto riguarda i vari dossier che sono pendenti tra la Commissione e l'Italia, si è detto anche che l'Italia offende la Commissione. Vorrei avere la sua posizione su questo considerando che lei non è soltanto la vice-Presidente della Commissione ma è anche ovviamente il membro italiano di questa Commissione. A: Questo significa chiaramente che io, per motivi di broadcasting, I am expected nel rispondere in italiano, volentieri. Innanzitutto su quest'ultima parte della domanda, è chiaro che io lavoro per tutta l'Unione europea e per tutti i cittadini europei, ma la mia storia politica, le mie idee, la mia nazionalità non per questo scompaiono da un giorno all'altro. I canali con il governo italiano ci sono, sono aperti, funzionano, sono costanti gli scambi e il lavoro comune tra le istituzioni europee e il governo italiano, per quello che io vedo quotidianamente sia, in quanto Vice-Presidente della Commissione sia in quanto Alto Rappresentante funzionano, quindi l'invito è a seguire le fonti ufficiali e non le fonti non specificate. Vorrei anche aggiungere una cosa: gli interessi dell'Italia e gli interessi dell'Unione europea coincidono e su due settori che sono fondamentali e per l'Italia e per la Commissione in particolare, ovvero la flessibilità nel campo economico e l'immigrazione Italia e Commissione lavorano per gli stessi obiettivi e che in un anno di lavoro abbiamo introdotto misure politiche, strumenti che fino ad un anno fa non c'erano e questo è stato grazie al lavoro congiunto dell'Italia, di altri Stati membri ovviamente e della Commissione che sono in questo senso dalla stessa parte. Questo non significa che tutto quello che è stato fatto vada bene, che tutto quello che è stato fatto basti, ma se guardiamo indietro di un anno né la flessibilità esisteva, né un inizio di un tentativo gestione comune dei processi migratori esisteva. E' l'agenda politica dell'Italia sicuramente, è l'agenda politica anche di altri Stati membri, è l'agenda politica della Commissione. Quindi è chiaro – credo che sia chiaro, anche se a volte mi sembra che sfugga ad altri commentatori – che siamo dalla stessa parte.  On Syria – Content of the Geneva talks –discussing the unity government as a starting point? A: It is quite clear in such a process that not only different points of view but also tensions - and even more than tensions - exist. We are dealing with the conflict, we are dealing with the war. You do not expect parties of a war to agree on something at the beginning of the process otherwise they would not be at war, most probably. What the process is about is first of all trying to define the political will and readiness of the parties, namely the regime and the opposition to come together and start a process.  A process that from our point of view is clearly one of transition. Transition that starts in one place which is the current state of play, which is a disaster since for five years now in terms of people dying, of people internally displaced and of people outside of the country. A humanitarian disaster first of all with the risk of a full generation lost. And the endpoint of a process that needs to start now is a place where probably not everybody will be friends and love each other, but find a way to put together the interests of the Syrians first and foremost, and try to overcome the civil war that is taking place in the country now for five years and unite forces against Da’esh - which is the real threat not only to the Syrian people but also to the rest of the region and the world. This doesn't mean that there are no other threats inside Syria. On the contrary. The European Union's position, when I mentioned a transition, is obviously to see Assad not to be part of the future of his country. But five years ago he was there, today he is there and Syria is where it is: in a disaster. So the point is to start a political process with the Syrians taking the leadership of a difficult process, of putting an end to their own internal war and focus together, joining forces, also joining forces with the rest of the region and the international community against the threat of Da’esh. I do not expect this process to be easy or even to be fast. But I expect this process to start in good faith and with enough political will inside Syria and outside Syria to allow it to start. Because I really believe the Syrians cannot sustain in any possible way another sixth year of war. We tend to forget the humanitarian dimension of this crisis; we tend to play geopolitics around this, with the different interests of the world powers, of the regional powers on it. Let's not forget that this is about children, women, men, people, every single day, being confronted with war. Thank you!

"Extracts from the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini's keynote address at the Conference ""The EU's Contribution to Global Rules: Challenges in an Age of Power Shifts"".",09.12.2015,09.12.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5506_en,http://eeas.europa.eu/documents/hrvpatthehague081215_en.pdf," The Hague, 8 December 2015 (…) Actually, you might even wonder if there is one international system. Borders are redrawn, terror spreads, and international norms are bent or broken. So, can we discuss about common global rules? That is the first question to ask ourselves. And let me answer very directly: not only we can but we must. This is not just an academic discussion, I believe; it is about our own future, our values and our interests, our place and our strength in the world. (…) But there is one mistake we cannot afford. We cannot be led by fear. We cannot act impulsively. Of course, we must react to crises, and sometimes we have the feeling of not doing anything else, but running from crisis to crisis. Of course, we have to react to crises, manage, in the best case scenario prevent, and manage the post-conflict. We have to be ready collectively for action here and now. But we must always be always driven by a vision of what we want to achieve, in the medium- and long-term, and how we want to get there. Emotional reactions can be very powerful but can only lead us so far. Un-strategic engagement can easily backfire. We need a strategy, a common one, to orientate our external action beyond the latest crisis, or the current one, and to prevent the next one. (…) I believe that in an age of power shifts, as we are living in, Europe can be a global power and a force for good. I believe that faced with increasing disorder, Europe must be the driving force pushing for a new global order: a global order based on rules, on cooperation, and on multilateral diplomacy. (…) Europe’s commitment to a rules-based multilateral order stems from our beliefs and from our principles, it stems from our identity. This is what we are and this is who we are. But it is also based on experience and realism. Our values and our interests converge upon the same goal. In a cooperative world order, Europe is safer and is stronger. (…) More recently, the temptation of a new Cold War has resurfaced as if the world was still the same - but it is not. I believe it is first of all our responsibility as Europeans and our interest to pass this message, to explain that now the world is not anymore like that. I believe no one in Europe can regret the end of an era of iron curtains and armed peace. But there is more than that. A new confrontation between world powers will not bring stability to the world, it would only let our common enemies prevail. It would soon give way to global chaos. For this is the alternative for our generation: a cooperative world order, or chaos. Terrorist groups like Da’esh are a threat to all nations, with no exceptions. Their goals are, in a way, very traditional: money, natural resources, power. At the same time, chaos is their breeding ground and their political goal; this is new. Against agents of chaos, we need cooperation among all nations: a global alliance against global disorder. Multilateralism is not the forgotten dream of the Nineties – it is the clarion call of our age. (…) 2015 has been an exceptional year for multilateralism. It has also been an exceptional year for crisis but also have to see the positive trends. Cooperation among world powers – the EU, the US, Russia and China – has led to a historic deal on Iran’s nuclear programme. The UN General Assembly and the Security Council in New York saw a growing consensus on the fight against Da'esh and other terrorist groups, and we had a global agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals. (…) We need cooperation on a global scale. But we also need to strengthen regional and sub-regional architectures. Our European Union has provided our continent with unprecedented peace. We were reminded of that very wisely. We had peace, stability and economic prosperity, even sometimes we tend to forget, how fortunate and lucky we are today. This is the result of courageous, wise choices that our founding fathers did many decades ago. And of the end of the day it was the choice of cooperation rather than confrontation after the most terrible war that the world had experienced. The same can happen with other regional organisations. (…) And on a smaller scale, addressing or preventing a crisis might require that we engage with regional and local players. We need to enlist all who have a concrete impact on the ground, with local authorities, with the communities, with the civil society and with religious leaders. We need to pioneer a new form of engagement in conflicts, by sharing responsibilities with other powers, with other forms of power. We have to think mega-regional and mini-lateral at the same time. (…) We cannot split the world in new spheres of influence: in an age of fast power shifts, it would only lead to perennial conflict. Think of the Middle East: drawing borders on sectarian lines would only produce more instability, more sectarianism and more hatred. In this world, walls are made to be torn down: they can only hide reality, but they do not make it better. We do not need new fences; we need to build up new spaces of coexistence and of cooperation. This is true in the Middle East as much as inside Europe. (…) I believe we are seeing - sometimes taking part in - the wrong debate, as if integration, further integration on the European side is opposed somehow to sovereignty and national sovereignty, as if the European project and the coming together as a Union is a way of renouncing sovereignty. I believe the contrary is true. The European Union is the only way to regain sovereignty in this complicated world. (…) Read the full text The Hague"
"Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the OSCE Ministerial Council in Belgrade, 3 December 2015",03.12.2015,03.12.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3062_en,,"Mr Prime Minister, Dear Friends and Colleagues, Forty years ago in Helsinki a fundamental and wise intuition was written down on paper: security in Europe needs cooperation in Europe. Today, the overwhelming feeling is that Europe is less secure than it used to be. The threats to our security have changed in nature. The means of our action must change too. But the core principle of our action is still the same that was defined in Helsinki 40 years ago: that cooperation is the key to our security. Cooperation inside the European Union, of course, and cooperation inside our continent. But as threats become global and borderless, cooperation on a global scale is also crucial. Security in Europe calls for a more cooperative and effective global order. The past year has been marked by focusing on international terrorism and cross-border refugee flows. These are challenges we share: we can only address them together. We are and must be united in this. Terrorism poses a direct threat to all countries and all people regardless of their ethnic background, religion or belief. Regardless of their nationality. The attacks in Paris, Ankara and Istanbul, Tunis, Beirut, Bamako and on a Saint Petersburg-bound airliner over Egypt – just to mention the most recent ones – are sad and clear reminders of this. Global terrorism can only be countered through international cooperation and determined national action. The defeat of Da'esh can only be achieved if we put an end to the Syrian civil war. And peace in Syria can only be achieved through a national, regional and international reconciliation: the process we started in Vienna is the only way forward. It is our common duty and responsibility to preserve and protect it, and make sure that our common work in that precious but difficult framework delivers. The world won't excuse us if we fail on this because of short-sighted divisions. We have a collective responsibility in front of our own citizens and the international community: put an end to the war in Syria and unite forces against Da'esh. The EU welcomes and supports the efforts by the OSCE to strengthen the capacities of participating States in the field of counter-terrorism and the prevention of radicalisation, as well as its efforts to foster partnerships with our Partners for Cooperation. Our discussions here in Belgrade offer the opportunity to make further progress in this respect. The conflicts in our neighbourhood – in Syria, in Libya and beyond – as well as poverty and the lack of socio-economic perspectives have led to refugee and migratory flows across neighbouring countries and Europe not seen in generations. As European Union, we have mobilised all instruments at our disposal to respond to this dramatic situation, supporting our friends in the region and finding ways in Europe. But no state can respond to such a challenge on its own. Only together, through cooperation, can we effectively manage the large flows of people, provide protection, and address the root causes of migration and displacement. The European Union is strengthening its partnerships with countries of origin and transit of migrants and refugees. In this respect, the OSCE constitutes a fundamental platform for dialogue and coordination. Its expertise on border management and the fight against the trafficking of human beings are even more valuable today. Because these are the two main issues we have to tackle together: addressing the root causes and dismantling the criminal transnational organizations and networks that are making money out of people's despair. Mr Chairman, Over the past year international cooperation on our common challenges has stepped to a new level. There are reasons for hope even in these difficult times. The nuclear deal with Iran will stay as a milestone in multilateral diplomacy. And today we all acknowledge that the terrorist threat can only be defeated in partnership. On migration, let me recognise that an almost unanimous vote in the UNSC endorsing the EU naval operation against human traffickers was a major achievement – also thanks to our common work with Russia. So there is space for a fruitful cooperation, in Europe and at a global level. At the same time, we still have to face hard and difficult divisions among us, on some key, basic issues. The illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation in eastern Ukraine continue to put fundamental OSCE principles into question. The situation created by the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula remains unchanged, and violations of human rights in Crimea by the de facto authorities have been repeatedly highlighted, including by ODIHR and the High Commissioner on National Minorities. In eastern Ukraine, the ceasefire largely holds and the level of violence has diminished compared to last year. However, foreign forces have not yet been withdrawn and the separatist-controlled areas, including the border area, remain out of reach for the legitimate Ukrainian authorities. The direct and indirect consequences for the civilian population are dire. The European Union sponsors all efforts for a solution that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. The European Union supports the efforts of the Trilateral Contact Group and Normandy Format to create the conditions in which the Minsk Agreements can be fully implemented: only their complete implementation can guarantee that this crisis will not turn into another protracted conflict. It is time for the participants in the Trilateral Contact Group and its sub-groups to show determination and achieve concrete progress. A crucial test will be the holding of local elections in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in accordance with Ukrainian law and relevant OSCE standards and monitored by ODIHR. The OSCE has a unique leading role both on the political track, in the Trilateral Contact Group and its sub-groups, and on the ground, undertaking crucial monitoring and verification. The Special Monitoring Mission must be able to continue its core stabilisation and transparency function without any obstacle. Jamming and denial of access to the monitors must stop, notably in the separatist-controlled areas and along the border with Russia. The European Union also highly values the work of the OSCE Project Coordinator in Ukraine and the important contributions made by the OSCE autonomous institutions, including in Crimea. With regard to other parts of the OSCE area, the EU is concerned about a very slow progress in conflict resolution related to Transnistria, rising tensions related to Nagorno-Karabakh and further entrenchment of the conflicts in Georgia. No benefits can be derived from perpetuating these conflicts.  For no one. We urge all parties involved to work in good faith towards political solutions that respect the OSCE's principles. The EU remains committed to be actively involved in the settlement processes. Mr Chairman, The European Union is more than ever committed to strengthening the OSCE as an instrument towards security and cooperation in Europe. Its comprehensive approach to security is the right one. There cannot be sustainable security without respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The European Union will keep working to strengthen the OSCE commitments in the human dimension, including with regard to fundamental freedoms. We are worried that the independence of the OSCE autonomous institutions, which assist participating States in the fulfilment of their commitments, has been put into question by some. The OSCE was born out of the need to increase confidence between opposing blocks of countries. Today we live in a different era of history. Still, we are far from having built that new world order that would guarantee real peace and cooperation in our continent. Most of the tools that were put in place 40 years ago remain necessary. Instruments of military transparency, in particular, could play an important role today in fostering confidence and stability. The European Union encourages all participating State to engage constructively in the modernisation and adaption of these valuable tools. Resolving the conflicts in the OSCE area and its neighbourhood, combatting terrorism, and managing the refugee crisis require our cooperation. The raison d'etre of the OSCE is confirmed each and every day: we need an even more solid framework for dialogue across Europe and beyond. It is cooperation that will build and safeguard our collective security and peace. We live in a very small world: only united will we make it more secure. Some are trying to foster divisions among us, because divisions make them strong. They are agents of chaos, as chaos is their breeding ground. Against these threats, our most effective answer is our cooperation. Against chaos, we have a duty and a common responsibility to work towards a more cooperative world order. It was the original intuition of the OSCE, and it’s even more relevant today. Let me thank the Serbian Chairmanship for its tireless efforts over the past year and for preparing today's discussion. Let me likewise assure the incoming Chair of our full support. Thank you! Belgrade,"

Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini ahead of the Meeting of Heads of State or Government of the European Union with Turkey,29.11.2015,29.11.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6422_en,,"Check against delivery! We have difficult times. All of us know very well that apart from the meeting of today, both us, Turkey, but also the region, Turkish people, the European people are all living in very difficult times. And I believe it is important to frame the day - that many describe as an important day - to frame the day of today in the broader picture. And it is a broader picture that sees us working closely with Turkey on many difficult issues, and very important for all of us. From Syria, which is the most urgent one, also because we always say we have to tackle the root causes of the refugee crisis - that is number one, to the internal situation in Turkey. Turkey comes out of a long electoral transition, now we have a government that is there to stay for some years and it is important for us to have a full-fledged dialogue with them on all the relevant issues. Obviously migration and the refugee crisis is one, but also others, including the revitalisation of the accession talks - you know we have been working on opening Chapters. This comes together with the new investment from the Turkish side on basic fundamental elements like human rights, media freedom, and I would like to stress in particular the need to re-start the Kurdish peace process. This was something that was on the table for two years after an initiative that President Erdoğan took at the time. It is important to revitalise it and the European Union will do this, will give all the support to restart the peace process with the Kurds. Let me say especially in these hours, after the killing of Mr Tahir Elci - that I would like to stigmatise as a terrible thing and express my condolences and my sympathy to his family, the people that have suffered and are suffering because of his killing: It is important even more today to restart the peace process with the Kurds. It is important for Turkey, it is important for the region, and it is important for the European Union. So after today we will obviously work on the refugee crisis. There is money that we intend to give to Turkey for the refugees. I would like to make this very clear - and we have done this, are doing the same with Lebanon and with Jordan: to show solidarity in this difficult task of welcoming and protecting refugees on our own territories. But from today onwards we will also - I will personally - work on High Level Dialogue with Turkey comprising all the different and sometimes difficult issues we have on the table with them. All of them, none excluded. Questions and Answers On Turkey – Russia tensions after downing of Russian jet. You know that I called the very same day first of all my friend, the Secretary General of NATO, to make sure that we have same kind of approach - scaling down the risks of escalation and calming and trying to calm down the situation, which was something that NATO I believe did in the meeting held that day. And also I was in contact that very same day with the Turkish Foreign Minister, that I will be happy to see here again today, and with the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov that I will also meet later this week, to make sure that this doesn't affect the political perspectives we have finally found in Vienna with talks that see all of us sitting around the table. Let me stress this very clearly. It would be a terrible mistake if, out of tensions on the ground that can be very high and very difficult to manage, we cancel or we downgrade the level of diplomatic and political engagement. The real way of defeating Da’esh in the long run is guaranteeing a political transition in Damascus, a ceasefire in Syria and unity of forces inside and outside Syria to fight against Dae’sh and al-Nusra. I believe we have to protect this political space we have finally created. Does the EU need Turkey more than before? No, we need each other. Turkey and Europe need each other. We are facing the same problems from the war in Syria, to terrorism to the stability or instability of the region. We need each other. We can be partners. We have to put all the issues we have on the table. All together. Thanks!  Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I113218 Bruxelles"

The European Union and China: global partners with global responsibilities,19.11.2015,19.11.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/15601_en,,"Global Vision Lectures The European Union and China: global partners with global responsibilities Tsinghua University Global Vision Lectures by H.E. Dr Hans – Dietmar Schweisgut Ambassador of the European Union to the People's Republic of China  Thursday 19 November 2015 Thank you for inviting me to give a speech in your series of 'Global Vision Lectures' . I have given it the title of 'The European Union and China, global players with global responsibilities', and both the timing and the place of this lecture are fitting. On timing , beyond just the fact that this is the 40 th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the European Union and China, we live in an age where our countries' successes and challenges are interconnected, truly global.  I have recently read the 5th Plenum's 'Proposals for the 13th Five Year Plan ', and a major theme is 'Going Global' .  And this applies not just to economic relations, trade and investment, but every bit as much to the environment and climate change, education and innovation, defence and security. As for the place , where better than Tsinghua University.  You started as a university which looked outwards: back in 1911 , Tsinghua was founded as a preparatory school for students about to be sent by the Chinese government to study in the United States. Today, with 45,000 students, many foreign, and with a world-class faculty, Tsinghua itself is a 'global player with global responsibilities' and one of the world's most prestigious universities. Only a few weeks ago I read that Tsinghua University has become the world's No 1 university for engineering research, according to the newly published American ranking of the world's top 750 universities.  And your new Schwarzman centre is proof of a global vision. Ladies and gentlemen, Let me start with a quote from my boss: On her first visit to China in May, Federica Mogherini , our High Representative for Foreign Policy said: "" 40 years is the time for maturity in a relationship. This means that we are ready to take stock of the achievements we have made, to face the differences - and sometimes also the difficulties- of a relationship, but also able to overcome them in a spirit of mutual cooperation. (…) Our partnership, initially focused on economic issues, has evolved into a political dialogue for the mutual benefit of our peoples. Even if we are geographically far from each other, today's global challenges know no borders - we have to address them together"" . So let me first set out the major challenges we both face , and then consider how best we can combine our strengths to address these shared challenges together. Let me start with a sad reflection on the recent terrorist attacks in Paris . We condemn in the strongest terms these brutal attacks against innocent civilians. This shameful act of terrorism will only achieve the opposite of its purpose, which was to divide, frighten, and sow hatred. I should add that China too faces a problem of terrorism, which is likely to get worse as you play a bigger role in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, The European Union is getting over the consequences of the financial crisis . Despite Greece making the headlines over large part of this year, the economic recovery in the euro area and the European Union as a whole is in its third year. Admittedly, growth rates are still modest and unemployment at high levels. At the beginning of his mandate, President Juncker said that his Commission would focus on ten political priorities , the key challenges that face both our economy and society .  If I were to list them, and you were not paying full attention, you might think that I was talking about China.  Which shows that in this globally interconnected world we face the same challenges.  Boosting employment , a connected single digital market , energy union and a climate change policy, a fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base , closer economic and monetary union , justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust, becoming a stronger global actor .  The EU or China?  Both. Let me talk about the current refugee crisis .  In the first nine months of 2015, over 710,000 people – refugees, displaced persons and other migrants – have made their way to Europe, a trend which is set to continue. What this says about Europe today is that it represents a beacon of hope , a haven of stability in the eyes of women and men in the Middle East and in Africa. Europe, in spite of differences between Member States, is by far the wealthiest and most stable continent in the world, and we do need to help those fleeing from war, terror and oppression. The refugee crisis might be the biggest challenge that the European Union has seen for decades and it has the potential to change the European Union. The only way to address this common challenge is by working together, with solidarity and responsibility . I am not going to say that is easy. We all know there is no magic, quick fix to the crises we have around us. And we need a global solution . We therefore called for a coordinated response, both to the short-term needs and the root causes. We do not ask our partners to do more than Europe does, but we ask the international community not to do less. All major countries should share the responsibilities associated with this crisis. Solidarity should be at the core of our decisions. We will continue to encourage all actors to step in and take a greater role in supporting the work we have ahead of us. Only two weeks ago we had a major summit with African leaders in Valletta, all with a view to find a balanced, cooperative approach to managing the Union's external borders. The Vienna Conference on Syria is another instance of trying to find a global solution to problems which affect us all.  I will come back to this issue later. China, too, is constantly changing, with its role reflecting the gradual evolution into what China calls a ""major country"" status . The recent state visit by President Xi to the United Kingdom, as well as the state visits by Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande to China, are a clear sign of closer relations between China and the EU.  President Xi's visit to the US was also a landmark. Just as we are continually adjusting our economy, so too China is moving towards a ""new normal"" and shifting gradually to an innovative, service-oriented and consumption-driven economy. The targets and reforms of the new draft Five Year Plan reflect a high ambition, and whatever the rate of growth, it will remain one of the highest in the world. 'Going Global' is the leitmotiv of China's international policy ambitions.  This approach of turning outwards is symbolised by the ambitions of the One Belt, One Road strategy , the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and BRICS Bank, the intention to internationalise the RMB.  Their significance is far deeper than just the building of infrastructure, trade and investment, important though those are.  It goes beyond financial infrastructure, information infrastructure and people to people 'infrastructure', if I may use the term.  For the new Silk Road to succeed, much more is needed, in particular two things: - Better economic global governance .  China has an important role, underlined by your chairmanship of the G20 meeting. - A secure and stable environment all the way from China to Europe, including in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and even Syria. Peaceful developments on the South China Sea, in the Malacca Straits, the Gulf of Aden are, in turn, the precondition for the 21 st Century Maritime Silk Road. All this calls for shared responsibility and, as President Xi recently said: "" adopting a new thinking of building partnerships, so as to jointly open up a new vista of common development and shared security "". This, of course, also opens up the necessity of a more strategic cooperation between the EU and China in the area of foreign and security policy. Now let me focus more closely on EU-China relations.  Speaking after the EU-China summit in June, President Tusk said : "" We decided to reinforce our EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda, which frames our relationship. We have also agreed with Premier Li the priorities for the up-coming year. This is an impressive list. It ranges from trade and investment to human rights and migration; from security and defence to climate change and development. And beyond. Because we share strategic interests. But also because of our commitment to address global challenges together "". 1. Economy The EU is China's biggest trading partner , and China is now close to becoming the EU's largest trading partner as well. In 2014, the total volume of trade in goods amounted to almost 470 billion euros. Investment both ways is also increasing. The EU is one of the top-five sources of foreign direct investment to China. At the same time, the recent statistics show that China's investment in the EU has now outpaced EU's investment in China. Even so, EU-China bilateral investment is only one tenth of EU-US bilateral investment. And our trade in services falls far short of our trade in goods. In 2013, China and the EU launched negotiations on a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment . If we are to take our relationship forward, 'to climb another storey higher ('geng shang yi ceng lou'), we have to increase market access for each other, to give our companies additional opportunities on a reciprocal basis . China will account for one third of global growth in the next 10 to 15 years and has already become an essential pillar of EU companies' strategies. The Chinese Government has clearly articulated its reform vision to move the Chinese economy up the value chain and innovation is to be one of the most critical drivers. EU industry and research has made and can still make further contributions to the Chinese innovation and modernisation agenda. But that requires a business environment which offers fair and transparent conditions for all economic actors in China. We are eager to see more Chinese investment in Europe which is the number one destination for foreign investment. The European Commission has put investment at the very heart of its agenda. We have launched an Investment Plan for Europe aiming at delivering €315 billion in extra investment within Europe. China has applied to become a member of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as a new way of boosting trade links with Europe and Asia. We welcome that, just as we welcome the fact that many European countries have applied to become founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), in order to complement existing multilateral development banks and to contribute to addressing Asia's need for infrastructure investment. At the last EU-China Summit in June, our leaders decided to support synergies between each other's flagship initiatives, namely the Investment Plan for Europe, and the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. We follow the Chinese initiative with great interest. Improving connectivity , both within and beyond the borders of the EU, is not just one of the most important political objectives of the Union, it is embedded it its very nature. The EU is, at heart, a connectivity initiative and we are glad to see that China is also interested in taking part in this process. We have already agreed on the main principles of how we want this collaboration to move forward. We also need to discuss horizontal issues which affect connectivity, such as technical standards or the existence of a level playing field for our companies. 2. Climate change Of all the global challenges in front of us, perhaps the most pressing one is the environment and climate change. In Europe we have learned that being ambitious in this area pays off : from 1990 to 2013, EU emissions declined 19%, while GDP grew 45%. That is why tackling global warming should be seen as an economic opportunity. The EU has now pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% from 1990 to 2030. China's commitment to ensuring a peak in its emissions by 2030 at the latest as well as the increased emphasis on improving the environment evident in the Proposals for the 13 th FYP show that we are on the same page. In the EU-China Statement on Climate Change both sides committed to embarking on low-carbon development and cooperate on developing a cost-effective low-carbon economy. We are working together to reach an agreement later this year in Paris on ambitious, binding international commitments to fight climate change. Climate change is a global strategic challenge .  A powerful global agreement at the Paris Conference is vital.  But at the heart of this lies co-operation on the environment within China, Europe and in third countries .  Strategic commitments to climate change cannot be achieved without effective measures in a wide range of areas such as pollution control, energy efficiency, circular development, changing systems, changing attitudes and many more.  This is why the increased weight given to the environment in the draft Five Year Plan is so important.  And here our companies, our researchers, our governance experts have much to co-operate over.  And forgive me for stressing this once again, but that co-operation will be more easily enhanced if there is greater openness to markets, better protection of IPR and a more transparent and vigorous exchange of ideas. (Intellectual input from experts from Tsinghua University). 3. Foreign policy and security Foreign policy and security co-operation has been the neglected younger cousin of our relations. This has to change.  We now live in a world so complex and so rapidly changing that single players alone simply cannot solve many of today’s problems , even if they are as powerful as the United States, the European Union or China. Global problems require global responses. Global players must take global responsibilities. China is increasingly doing this, something which we support. We need to work together to create a world based on rules and respect for international order . The multiplication of both global challenges and opportunities requires a strong multilateral system, with the United Nations and World Trade Organisation at its heart. The EU and the People's Republic of China, both founded in the aftermath of the Second World War, need to work together for a world which is based on the same principles upon which the United Nations was founded in 1945: universal peace, international security guaranteed by international law and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. We need to respect and promote human rights, democracy and rule of law, as well as social progress and better standards of life. In the context of the United Nations' 70th anniversary, our recent summit also committed to develop further EU-China bilateral exchanges and cooperation on peace and security under the UN umbrella. Let me cite a positive example: the UN Security Council's authorisation of Member States to intercept vessels off Libyan coast suspected of migrant smuggling. After the vote - and China voted in favour - the Chinese representative said that the causes of illegal migration were complex and urged an integrated approach, focused on poverty, social unrest and conflict. Communications with regional and sub-regional organisations were important. Let me tell you that European action in the region goes exactly in that direction. Not only did we launch operations to fight human smugglers, but also – at the last week's Valetta summit with African countries - we launched the EU Trust Fund with a minimum of 1.8 billion euros. This comes on top of EU and Member States' development assistance to African countries of 20 billion euros every year. The fund will help promote economic opportunities, development, security and a better management of irregular migration in partnership with African countries. China's economic engagement in Africa should be another stabilising factor in the region , and we should seek coherence of our actions on the continent. We all know that destabilisation and insecurity travel very quickly and have potentially devastating consequences. There is, however, wider scope for cooperation , and both the European Union and China have a host of experience to share. Since the creation in March 2002 of the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, some 30 civilian and military missions and operations have been launched under the Common Security and Defence Policy, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad, South Sudan, Somalia, Mali, Niger, Afghanistan and Iraq. China , over the years, has sent more than 30,000 peacekeepers to 24 different peacekeeping operations , and today it provides around 3,000 of the more than 106,500 U.N. troops, police and advisers deployed by all countries, making it the ninth biggest contributor of peacekeeping personnel. China is certainly playing an increasing important role: recently, China dispatched an infantry battalion of 700 soldiers to South Sudan to protect civilians, United Nations employees and humanitarian workers as part of the peacekeeping force there. And, at the United Nations General Assembly, President Xi announced plans to set up a United Nations permanent peacekeeping force of 8,000 troops and provide $100 million to the African Union over the next five years to create an immediate response unit capable of responding to emergencies. We need also to increase our common diplomatic efforts . Back in June, at the summit, we agreed that the conflict in Ukraine could only be solved by diplomatic means and through full respect for international law. This is an area where both China and the European Union should continue to use our influence to ensure full implementation of all points in the Minsk Agreements by all sides. The deal we reached last summer on Iran's nuclear programme shows the way: when global powers from all continents cooperate – Europe, Russia, China and the US – the chances of success escalate. The Iran deal, although primarily a non-proliferation deal, is a model for addressing other problems , including how to provide security for the One Belt, One Road strategy, which will require that sort of all round cooperation.  The same applies to Syria – and indirectly the refugee crisis in Europe.  On Syria, the EU and China need to work hand in hand, all of us playing our respective roles, be they financial assistance, constructive participation in the Vienna Conference. This will contribute to putting an end to the suffering of the Syrian people, the physical destruction of Syria, the destabilisation of the region, the resulting increase in terrorists drawn to the fighting in Syria, the refugee crisis. 4. Terrorism This brings me to combatting terrorism. In the last couple of months we have witnessed heinous terrorist attacks in Ankara, Beirut , on a Russian plane in Sinai and finally, last week, in Paris . The spread of terrorist organisations and acts of terrorism directly undermine the maintenance of international peace and security; they endanger our efforts to strengthen the global economy and to ensure sustainable growth and development. They have also underlined once again the need for increased international cooperation .  Terrorists cross borders; counter-terrorism efforts must cross borders too. As agreed in G20 last Monday, we must tackle the financing channels of terrorism and address the conditions which breed terrorism. We must counter violent extremism, combat radicalisation and recruitment, hamper terrorist movements, counter terrorist propaganda and prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communications and resources to incite terrorist acts, including through the internet. Fighting terrorism is seen as operations on the ground, such as in Syria. If we are to be honest we need to state one thing clearly. It was not the moderate Syrian opposition which carried out the attacks in Paris. It was the so-called Islamic State or Da'esh . We need to concentrate our actions on Da'esh and the phenomenon of foreign fighters , including Europeans and Chinese fighting in Syria.  But it is just as important to prevent the conditions which allow terrorism to breed and fester to develop or persist.  Economic opportunity is an important tool, but so too is a greater understanding and tolerance of religion, culture and way of life.  Our experience inside and outside the EU is that one of the major causes of radicalisation which leads to terrorism is making a minority feel left out from society as a whole.  Getting this balance between control and latitude is very difficult and I have no easy answer, but it must be attempted. 5. International development Another important area for our collaboration is the issue of the post-2015 development agenda . The past 10-15 years have seen an impressive increase in the public domestic resources available to a number of developing countries. But still, many of those countries have not been able to step up public expenditures in a sustainable way and to achieve development goals, despite sustained growth rates and abundant natural resources. China has shown the way to success . In a little more than three decades it has lifted 600 million out of poverty. In September, in the margins of the landmark 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , which outlines a new framework for national and international action for global poverty eradication and sustainable development . The agenda acknowledges our shared responsibilities and our shared destiny, is accepted by all countries and is applicable to all, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities. The goals will stimulate action over the next fifteen years of critical importance for humanity. 6. Human rights As a sign of maturity of our relationship, the EU and China can also talk about more difficult issues including human rights. As President of the European Parliament Schulz said earlier this year in his speech to CASS, “Maybe one of the greatest achievements of the last 40 years is exactly the fact that we are able to discuss human rights in an open and frank way.”  I hope that these exchanges can continue to show mutual respect and can be ever more constructive, leading to the fulfilment of both sides’ obligations under UN human rights mechanisms .  So I am looking forward to the next round of our human rights dialogue at the end of this month.  We do not approach these dialogues in the manner of someone lecturing.  We do not seek to impose our values.  But we do want to discuss – calmly and maturely - how both sides can fully implement the commitments they have made under international conventions.  This is not interference in the internal affairs of the other side.  Just as personal friends should be frank, so should countries.  China wishes to strengthen its soft power; how it treats lawyers, whether defendants are given access to legal counsel or visits from relatives, these sorts of actions raise serious questions about China's stated commitment to strengthening the rule of law, and thereby diminish China's soft power and reputation. 7. People-to-people Long-term partnership between the European Union and China would not be possible without the ‘ lao bai xing’ , the man and woman in the street, seeing clear benefits.  All the elements which leaders and officials put emphasis on, trade, strategic or environmental co-operation, are unattainable without the support of the people.  If we do not understand each other, do not appreciate the differences in our culture, if we cannot communicate successfully, then all sorts of interactions will be hindered. The framework is important, yes.  We hold the EU-China High Level People-to-People Dialogue (September was the last occasion).  But what makes the real difference is the vast number of interactions and exchanges which we in government and officialdom cannot see.  All we can do as governments and officials is boost the conditions which encourage them to take place. That means more academic contacts . There are 300,000 Chinese students at European universities; our universities are keen to welcome more. At the same time we welcome China’s providing opportunities for our young to study in China and to get to know Chinese people.  This is an invaluable investment for the future.  Currently there are 50,000, but their number is growing, as the interest in China grows. We are increasingly opening our exchange programmes to foreign students . We are proud that as of last year, our flagship programme Erasmus+ opened up credit mobility to all countries in the world.  This year 1,329 Chinese students will benefit. Tourism is another important way of getting to know each other better. Europe is the number one tourist destination in the world. We want more Chinese tourists. 6 million people travel yearly between Europe and China, and there is clearly scope for even more. And let us both work towards a far greater volume of cultural exchange .  Both China and the EU have long and glorious cultures. This lecture has partially veered away from the global to the bilateral .  I make no apology for that.  I am talking to China's most intelligent students and you will have already related what I have said to the wider context: what applies to the relations between the EU and China, applies as much to relations between the EU and Africa, the EU and the US; between China and Latin America, China and Australia.  Pick your combination. I have also talked about the traditional areas of co-operation .  But again, your brains are faster than mine and will have seen that what I have said about them applies just as much to new areas of global co-operation, or if we are foolish, new areas of global confrontation: space, cyber, polar regions, the deep seabed , and some we may not yet have foreseen. If we are to manage traditional and new areas of relations, in this far more complex, multilateral, less bilateral fashion, then we are going to have to make 'win-win' more than a catchy slogan ; it has to be a real guiding philosophy.  And that will involve some painful rethinking .  For the EU, for China, for America, for everyone .  For example, within Europe we shall have to get better at putting our collective interests before the interests of our member states – a smaller share of a bigger pie is a bigger gain.  Another example, we cannot call on China to assume a greater share of global responsibilities without giving China a greater say in necessary changes to economic or other aspects of global governance.  And yes, China too will need to put its wider longer term interests in front of narrow immediate gains , be it in ensuring true reciprocity in economic opening, or in submitting claims to international arbitration. And this process of global sharing and compromise , of multilateral over bilateral , will continue to change and evolve, more quickly than in the past. The world of flexibility, innovation, mutual understanding and compromise is what Tsinghua University has to prepare its students for. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk today.  Forgive me if I mention another university.  In April, to mark the 40 th anniversary we inaugurated ""The EU-China Friendship Garden"" in a ceremony on the Beijing Foreign Studies University campus. For this occasion, a total of 29 trees were planted: 28 ginkgo trees representing the 28 EU Member States, as well as one oak tree, representing the EU-China partnership. Ginkgo Biloba trees symbolise longevity and tenacity and have been cultivated in China for over 1,500 years. The oak tree, also known as the Tree of Life, is a symbol of strength and endurance and was regarded as a sacred tree in many parts of Europe in ancient times. Its roots penetrate deep into the ground and its branches reach high to the heavens. Let me wish the same for the future of the EU-China partnership, leaders in a global partnership. Beijing"
Remarks by High Representative/ Vice- President Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council,16.11.2015,16.11.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5565_en,,"Check against delivery Merci beaucoup et excusez-moi pour le retard. La journée a été un peu particulière comme vous l'imaginez bien. Nous avons commencé nos travaux avec une discussion sur les attaques terroristes à Paris, mais aussi à Beyrouth, en Egypte, en Turquie, en Irak, dans la région. Nous avons tout d'abord écouté l'intervention de notre collègue français et nous avons souligné l'importance de travailler avec urgence et unité à résoudre les principales crises qui sont à la base des menaces auxquelles nous faisons face. Notamment la Syrie, je vais revenir sur cela dans une minute. Mais ce n'est pas quelque chose de nouveau. Déjà en février, après les attaques à Charlie Hebdo nous avions décidé ensemble, et nous l'avons fait, de renforcer la coopération contre le terrorisme avec les pays clés de la région, notamment les pays du Moyen Orient, du Maghreb, du Sahel, la Turquie. Nous avons également déployé 8 experts contre-terrorisme dans les pays clés de la région. Nous avons travaillé durant ces mois pour soutenir les capacités de sécurité de pays clés, comme la Tunisie d'un côté et l'Irak de l'autre part. Et, nous avons bien sûr renforcé le rôle, le travail, de nos missions au Sahel. Et ce, parce que même lorsqu'on regarde au Moyen Orient il faut garder à l'esprit le fait qu'il y a des menaces terroristes aussi dans l'Afrique sub-saharienne. Nous avons ainsi renforcé nos missions au Sahel, dans leur rôle de conseil en matière de sécurité du pays concerné. Ce sont, bien sûr, des activités qui représentent un investissement pour le futur de la sécurité de la région, des régions concernées. Elles porteront également leurs fruits en Europe avec le temps, car elles sont complémentaires au travail indispensable et urgent de nos collègues, Ministres de l'Intérieurs et, sur le volet extérieur, ceux de la Défense, avec l'aspect militaire de la gestion de la crise, dont on parle. Je vais avoir demain le Conseil des Ministres de la Défense, comme vous le savez. Nous commencerons par discuter ces points avec le Ministre français de la Défense Jean-Yves Le Drian comme premier point de la journée de demain. As we see from discussions in Antalya in these hours, fighting terrorism is a common issue, global, as the G20 recalls and as we have discussed today with the Ministers. A global threat, not only European, not only in the Mediterranean region, but a global threat and a global responsibility to prevent it and to fight it in the only way that we see can be effective and also sticking to our values, which is coming together. Coming together in our differences is our strength - as Europeans and with our neighbours and we are going to keep this. I have shared with the Ministers one fear that I have: it is that European societies might think that it is diversity that weakens us or threatens us. Well, actually it is the fear of diversity that can destroy our societies from within. And this is another threat we are facing, together with the very concrete one that we have seen in the streets of Paris last Friday night. So, it is a cultural, a political response that we also need. The one of keeping the nature of open societies that make Europe what it is. Coming together is also what we did finally on Syria in these last weeks. We had today most of our time dedicated on working on a political solution to the Syria conflict. This would be also the best possible way providing the conditions to defeat Da'esh. Putting an end to the war in Syria would create the conditions to defeat Da'esh on the ground, starting from Syria and obviously also in Iraq and elsewhere. So we have worked in the last couple of months to have a format and the process started. Just two months ago - we were remembering today with Staffan de Mistura who joint us today for the discussions and all the ministers - we were all in New York in the margins of the General Assembly. We were meeting with Staffan de Mistura and listing all the difficulties that we were seeing in front of ourselves in working towards the beginning of a process, of a format that could have brought together all the relevant regional and international actors. Two months ago, that was the European agenda, the UN agenda, but it seemed very far away. Today, two months afterwards, we have had two meetings in Vienna with the format that we had foreseen as an objective for us and that is now in place - not by chance, I will not say it's thanks only to the European Union, it's thanks to the efforts of many in the International Community. But let me say that it is also thanks to our common and coordinated work that we have managed to bring together countries from Iran to Saudi Arabia, from Turkey to Egypt, from the US and Russia, leading a process that can give us some space to do three things at the same time: starting the political process for a transition in Syria; in parallel working on a national-wide ceasefire, except obviously from the fight against terrorist organisations namely Da'esh and Al- Nusra; and thirdly, working on the humanitarian assistance on the ground to improve the living conditions of the Syrian people in Syria and allow them to live in decent ways. Humanitarian work can also help the political process to take shape. The EU is playing this role, not only in the start of this process, not only in bringing the actors around the table, but also we are ready to play our role in the process that is starting. We discussed today our contribution on the work that we will do together with the others around the table in Vienna, and I will guarantee that all Member States feed in this process equally and in a coordinated way so those that are sitting around the table themselves, but also those that are sitting around the table through me representing them all. We are ready to contribute on different levels, as I said on the humanitarian one there are specific projects that the European Union is suggesting and is ready to work on, if you want I can go more in details on that. Second on the work on the opposition in Syria. We need not only to unite but also make sure that their contribution to the process happens from the beginning and in a constructive and coordinated way. And also on the work on counter-terrorism. This is a work that needs to be done in details to get to a common understanding among all the different regional and mainly international actors of who is a terrorist organisation and who is not. We have a very solid basis, which is the UN Security Council decisions on this and for sure Da'esh and Al-Nusra are clearly listed in that. So, whatever ceasefire will or can be built in the coming months, obviously it will not concern actions against these two organisations in their different forms. As you know from Vienna on Saturday, we decided quite an ambitious timetable. We believe that this can be respected and that there is a sense of urgency coming from Europe that could not be ignored by any of the actors, being them regional or international, around the table. Europe is one of the areas which is the most affected by the terrorist threat, by the crisis of refugees fleeing the country and it's one of the actors that is investing more money in the humanitarian aspect of dealing with the crisis. We have a cooperative approach. We believe that the only way to solve this crisis is through bringing together different actors. This needs to bring results, sooner rather than later. It has to be a matter of months and not years. I believe all the actors around the table now acknowledge the need to change attitude to this crisis. It is not just one crisis, but it is the most serious war that we are facing in our times. We also discussed with the Ministers migration. Let me stress, so that there is no confusion on the political side, on the institutional side - and I know that President Hollande is saying exactly the same things in these very same moments in the Congress- that there must be no mix, no confusion between the issue of migration and refugees and the terrorist threats. We have to keep that very clear in mind. Any mix, any confusion, any amalgam, as someone coming in this morning said, would be extremely dangerous, extremely counterproductive for our own public opinions and for our own continent. We have a duty to protect those in need of protection that are escaping from the very same threats that we are facing in Europe today. We have to be very clear on that. On migration, we discussed the follow-up of the decisions we have already taken, both on the central Mediterranean routes, a few days after the Malta Summit, and on the Eastern route, the Western Balkan one. We have focussed the Foreign Ministers work on the external actions that need to implement the two agendas we have, which are good ones. If you want, I can go more in details on this following your questions. But mainly we have focused on cooperation on different aspects of common policies we have with our partners in Africa and Northern Africa. I will travel to Chad this week to start a first work on implementation with our friends of the G5 Sahel but also obviously to work on security aspects with them. On the Western Balkans and Eastern routes, obviously, we have discussed our cooperation with Turkey, but also with Lebanon and Jordan, which are three dimensions of our work in the Middle East that are essential to us. And, let me stress that our cooperation with Turkey, in particular, but also with the other two, should not be based purely on the issue of refugees and managing the refugee flows and borders. This is obviously a key element of our cooperation, but has different dimensions, multiple dimensions to which we have to give broader political framework. This is something I have discussed with the Turkish Foreign Minister on Saturday in Vienna and we are working on this. So, not only, a summit, but also a High level ministerial dialogue that we will have hopefully in the coming weeks. Because again, our relation with Turkey does not limit itself to the issues of borders and refugees. Last but not least, we had an update on our work on the Middle East Peace Process, on our engagement with our Israeli and Palestinian friends and in the Quartet. I updated the Ministers on the steps forward. I also updated them on the guidelines that were adopted on the indication of origin last week. We have decided to come back to this issue in December, once the Quartet Envoys will have paid visit to the institutions in Israel and Palestine, hopefully before mid-December. We had foreseen a point on the agenda on Eastern partnership. For me it was especifically relevant to update the Ministers on two visits I have done last week in Kiev and in Tbilisi. We will have just in a few hours the Association Council with Georgia as well and we have a difficult situation in Moldova. Unfortunately, today the situation was clearly quite exceptional. Our timetable was a little bit reviewed. So, this will be the first point of our discussion in December for all the Ministers to be able to be there, discussing our Eastern partners and relations with them. Thank you.

Statement of the International Syria Support Group,14.11.2015,14.11.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3088_en,," Vienna, November 14, 2015 Meeting in Vienna on November 14, 2015 as the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), the Arab League, China, Egypt, the EU, France, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United Nations, and the United States to discuss how to accelerate an end to the Syrian conflict. The participants began with a moment of silence for the victims of the heinous terrorist attacks of November 13 in Paris and the recent attacks in Beirut, Iraq, Ankara, and Egypt. The members unanimously condemned in the strongest terms these brutal attacks against innocent civilians and stood with the people of France. Subsequently, the participants engaged in a constructive dialogue to build upon the progress made in the October 30 gathering. The members of the ISSG expressed a unanimous sense of urgency to end the suffering of the Syrian people, the physical destruction of Syria, the destabilization of the region, and the resulting increase in terrorists drawn to the fighting in Syria. The ISSG acknowledged the close linkage between a ceasefire and a parallel political process pursuant to the 2012 Geneva Communique, and that both initiatives should move ahead expeditiously. They stated their commitment to ensure a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition based on the Geneva Communique in its entirety. The group reached a common understanding on several key issues. The group agreed to support and work to implement a nationwide ceasefire in Syria to come into effect as soon as the representatives of the Syrian government and the opposition have begun initial steps towards the transition under UN auspices on the basis of the Geneva Communique. The five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council pledged to support a UNSC resolution to empower a UN-endorsed ceasefire monitoring mission in those parts of the country where monitors would not come under threat of attacks from terrorists, and to support a political transition process in accordance with the Geneva Communique. All members of the ISSG also pledged as individual countries and supporters of various belligerents to take all possible steps to require adherence to the ceasefire by these groups or individuals they support, supply or influence. The ceasefire would not apply to offensive or defensive actions against Da’esh or Nusra or any other group the ISSG agrees to deem terrorist. The participants welcomed UN Secretary General Ban’s statement that he has ordered the UN to accelerate planning for supporting the implementation of a nationwide ceasefire. The group agreed that the UN should lead the effort, in consultation with interested parties, to determine the requirements and modalities of a ceasefire. The ISSG expressed willingness to take immediate steps to encourage confidence-building measures that would contribute to the viability of the political process and to pave the way for the nationwide ceasefire. In this context, and pursuant to clause 5 of the Vienna Communique, the ISSG discussed the need to take steps to ensure expeditious humanitarian access throughout the territory of Syria pursuant to UNSCR 2165 and called for the granting of the UN’s pending requests for humanitarian deliveries. The ISSG expressed concern for the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons and the imperative of building conditions for their safe return in accordance with the norms of international humanitarian law and taking into account the interests of host countries. The resolution of the refugee issue is important to the final settlement of the Syrian conflict. The ISSG also reaffirmed the devastating effects of the use of indiscriminate weapons on the civilian population and humanitarian access, as stated in UNSCR 2139. The ISSG agreed to press the parties to end immediately any use of such indiscriminate weapons. The ISSG reaffirmed the importance of abiding by all relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including UNSCR 2199 on stopping the illegal trade in oil, antiquities and hostages, from which terrorists benefit. Pursuant to the 2012 Geneva Communique, incorporated by reference in the Vienna statement of October 30, and in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118, the ISSG agreed on the need to convene Syrian government and opposition representatives in formal negotiations under UN auspices, as soon as possible, with a target date of January 1. The group welcomed efforts, working with United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura and others, to bring together the broadest possible spectrum of the opposition, chosen by Syrians, who will decide their negotiating representatives and define their negotiating positions, so as to enable the political process to begin. All the parties to the political process should adhere to the guiding principles identified at the October 30 meeting, including a commitment to Syria’s unity, independence, territorial integrity, and non-sectarian character; to ensuring that State institutions remain intact; and to protecting the rights of all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity or religious denomination. ISSG members agreed that these principles are fundamental. The ISSG members reaffirmed their support for the transition process contained in the 2012 Geneva Communique. In this respect they affirmed their support for a ceasefire as described above and for a Syrian-led process that will, within a target of six months, establish credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, and set a schedule and process for drafting a new constitution. Free and fair elections would be held pursuant to the new constitution within 18 months. These elections must be administered under UN supervision to the satisfaction of the governance and to the highest international standards of transparency and accountability, with all Syrians, including the diaspora, eligible to participate. Regarding the fight against terrorism, and pursuant to clause 6 of the Vienna Communique, the ISSG reiterated that Da’esh, Nusra, and other terrorist groups, as designated by the UN Security Council, and further, as agreed by the participants and endorsed by the UN Security Council, must be defeated. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan agreed to help develop among intelligence and military community representatives a common understanding of groups and individuals for possible determination as terrorists, with a target of completion by the beginning of the political process under UN auspices. The participants expect to meet in approximately one month in order to review progress towards implementation of a ceasefire and the beginning of the political process. Bruxelles"
"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the joint press conference with Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine in Kyiv, 9 November 2015",09.11.2015,09.11.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5908_en,,"Check against delivery. It is always a pleasure to be here in Kyiv. As you have said Mr President, the main purpose of my visit here, apart from all the issues we have discussed, is to show that the situation in Ukraine remains top priority on the European agenda. While the European Union is focusing on what is happening at our southern and south-eastern borders with conflicts in the Mediterranean region, it is very crucial that we keep focused, united as Europeans, on the situation in Ukraine. I have spent part of the first year of my mandate explaining that our attention to the East should not overshadow the need to work together on the south of our neighbourhood. Now I am sending a complementary message that as we focus very much on the migration crisis, on the Mediterranean, on the Middle East, we have to keep very high and top of our agenda our common work on the situation in eastern Ukraine, the non-recognition policy of the annexation of Crimea, and the reform process in Ukraine itself. I hope that my presence here and the presence of many of my colleagues from the Commission in the coming days - I think there are going to be some four, five visits in the next weeks here from Brussels at the highest possible levels - are a concrete sign of the fact that Ukraine stays extremely high on our common agenda, because we share a path and we need to work together. It is indeed my second visit here in one year. I was really glad to meet my friend, the President. I started my visit with meetings with civil society representatives and Crimean Tatar leaders, extremely useful and good for me, and I hope also for them in exchanging views and discussing the way forward. I am also having meetings with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Speaker of the Parliament and members of the Parliament themselves as well as then a coordination meeting with all the ambassadors of the European Union countries here in Kyiv. Meeting with the President was not only a pleasure - like every time we meet here in Kyiv, or in Brussels or everywhere else in the world, which happens luckily quite often and in a very productive way - it was mainly a moment for us to compare notes on where we are on two main issues. On one side - the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. We shared the assessment of the fact that we are today in a much better position than it was the case months ago, with the ceasefire finally in place and the withdrawal of weapons started. Still we have a number of important steps on which we work together, together with the rest of the international community - together with the OSCE, with working groups, with the Normandy format that just a few days ago met on the level of the Foreign Ministers in Berlin - that I hope can open the way for further steps both on the security track and on the political one when it comes to full implementation of all points of the Minsk Agreements by all sides. We have discussed this at length, including obviously the modalities for local elections in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of Ukrainian law and in line with ODIHR standards. Another immediate concern is access for OSCE SMM and humanitarian organisations. On these issues immediate and consistent progress is needed. We also discussed very concrete and practical work that we can do together - for example the European Union can work on something crucial like demining of some areas that could be relevant for further steps. We also discussed at length our bilateral issues, in particular the trade part of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement that is going to be provisionally applied as of 1 January 2016. We have done a lot to start the preparation of the implementation of this agreement. We have agreed to make the most of the remaining time in order to find practical solutions to Russia's concerns over the implementation of the agreement. As you know, the European Union is facilitating the talks on this issue, as well as on the gas/energy talks. We spent a large part of our time, of our meeting discussing the reforms - not general, theoretical issues, but very concrete ones. First of all, we stressed the need to deliver on the anti-corruption reform, which is the key to the credibility and the sustainability of all the other reforms. I discussed this at length with the President, but also with representatives of the civil society. And that is going to be key also for the implementation of the trade part of the Association Agreement, it is also one important element of our discussions on Visa Liberalisation Action Plan. I stressed the need to have anti-corruption bodies that can start the work soon, and I know the President is fully committed to that and with the trusted leadership selected through a credible and transparent process. We have also discussed, as you mentioned, public administration reform, judiciary reform and other crucial reforms, and we are and we remain ready to support you on all these steps in a very concrete way. I would stop here because I know we run late. We had, as always, good meetings, which also means long ones and fruitful ones, so I stop here.

"Speech by HR/VP Federica Mogherini at ASEF Young Leaders Summit, Luxembourg, 4 November 2015",04.11.2015,04.11.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5927_en,,"Speech by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at ASEF Young Leaders Summit, Luxembourg, 4 November 2015 Check against delivery!  Dear Young Asian Leaders,  Dear Young European Leaders,  Great to see you here today. This Asia-Europe Young Leaders Summit is the first of its kind in the margins of an ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting. I hope you have enjoyed it and found it useful. On my side, I hope we can repeat this in the coming years, for at least two reasons. The first one: it is good that we listen to young leaders like you. You are not just the leaders of the future, as everyone always tells you. You can be the leaders of today as well.  So I am happy that two of your representatives will speak in the opening session of our ""adult"" Asia-Europe meeting. This never happened before. And there was indeed some mumbling amongst officials who felt this was unorthodox [because young people might say controversial things!].  But I felt that it was important that the results of your deliberations this week are heard directly by the Ministers. That the politicians listen to what the new generations have to say about the future of Europe and Asia.  Rather than speaking myself, I therefore hope that we could engage in a dialogue. That you can tell me about your worries and your hopes.  The second reason why I am happy about this Young Leaders summit is this. The Asia-Europe Summit was ""invented"" at the end of the Cold War: its founders realised that the new situation called for an alliance among continents and civilisations. Twenty years on – and after too many conflicts – it is even clearer that only an intercontinental alliance can tackle the challenges of today. Cooperation between Asia and Europe will become more and more important. Building alliances calls for strong institutions, but also for strong connections between leaders. And it is great that you, future leaders, are having a chance to meet with one another. Years ago I took part in many events like this one, so believe me: it was worth it. Everything you learn here, every person you meet might be important to your future.  ****  When I was your age, the world looked differently. After the fall of the Berlin wall, we had high hopes that the world would enter an unprecedented era of stability, peace and prosperity. That the world would no longer be divided in blue states and red states. That a new, multilateral order was born.  When you, young leaders, look forward, you must see a different future. One of insecurity, around Europe; of unresolved and boiling, historic tensions, also around Asia; of economic slowdown, in Europe and on a smaller scale in Asia too. A world where borders are blurred. Because of all these factors, put together, this is also a world where many people are afraid. Afraid of unemployment. Afraid of conflicts. And too often, afraid of ""the other"", the foreigner, the worshipper of another faith, the migrant. In our globalised world nationalism, ""tribalism"", sectarianism have not disappeared at all.  ****  Yet, I am sure many of you look at the future with optimism. I am myself a staunch optimist, and I think there are good reasons to be. Inequalities are still huge, but the world has never been this rich. We get better and better at fighting diseases. Children mortality has reduced drastically. And as you all know, a more connected world provides us with so many new opportunities.  Take the work we do on connectivity . It is today a buzz-word in Asia; but has long been at the heart of the European project.  Connecting people – or mobility – brings enormous benefits: economic, societal, cultural. Tearing down our internal frontiers has always been a key part of the European Union's project. And it still is, although it is painful to watch some of our member states build fences at their borders.  I am an Erasmus alumnus. Since 1987 more than 3 million students have participated in this brilliant scheme of student exchange. About one fifth of them have taken the idea of people-to-people contact to a new level, by finding their spouse during their Erasmus stay. There is an increasing number of ‘Erasmus children’.  With my colleague, Commissioner Navracsics, I want to enlarge Erasmus to include also exchange with third countries (the so called Erasmus Mundus). In 2015, 4465 students of Asian ASEM countries studied in Europe; and 2584 European students went to study Asian ASEM countries. I would like to see those numbers increase over the next years.  In this context I would like to pay special tribute to the Asia Europe Foundation, ASEF, for your strong focus on fostering educational exchanges between Asia and Europe: the ASEF Higher Education Program, the ASEF University and the related networks are flagship projects.  Connectivity is also about bringing down obstacles to trade . We want goods and services to move freely within the EU. We are proud of the single market, although it is not quite finished. Regional infrastructure – the so-called Trans-European Networks – support this market.  In South East Asia, ASEAN is building its own community . Different pace, different institutional set-up; but the objective is similar: creating growth and prosperity by making it easier to trade, travel and do business.  That's why we feel naturally close to ASEAN and we fully support their community building. Not to transpose our model; not to teach lessons of integration; but to share experiences and lessons learned.  Beyond building our internal markets, we need to connect European and Asian economies . There are more goods and services travelling between Europe and Asia than across the Atlantic. The potential is huge.  Last month, the Commission adopted a new Trade and Investment Strategy . For Asia , it is the most ambitious ever: Beyond the concluded negotiations (with Korea, Singapore and Vietnam), and the ongoing ones (Malaysia, Thailand, Japan), the Commission has announced its wish to negotiate with Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia; and indeed a full EU-ASEAN free trade agreement when all conditions are fulfilled.  ****  Connectivity can do much to strengthen the economies of Asia and Europe, and move beyond the current economic slowdown. But there is another key condition to make sure Asia continues to grow. Asia needs peace and stability. It needs to avoid new confrontations that would benefit no one.  In May this year, I attended the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore, a yearly gathering of Ministers of Defence from Europe and Asia, defence community and think tanks. I was impressed by how many of them asked for greater cooperation between Europe and Asia on security issues.  And on our side, on the side of the EU, there is so much we can do. The European Union is not just a big free trade area. We are also a foreign policy community, a security and defence provider . For our own people and in the rest of the world, including in Asia. Let me give you just a few examples.  Some of you might know about such engagement, but let me tell you: many European citizens don't. And of course most Asian citizens don't. But when you'll be in leadership positions, keep this in mind. Europe has a stake in Asia's security, and has a stake in cooperation with Asia.  ****  Cooperation will be particularly crucial on a number of global issues . For your generation, climate change has never been a distant perspective. It is a reality, you all know it is already happening.  The stakes for COP21 in Paris are huge. Failing to reach an ambitious, comprehensive and legally binding agreement would be – quite literally – a global disaster.  Tomorrow, the Foreign Ministers here in Luxembourg will represent 60% of global GDP. If we reach an agreement here, it can pave the way for Paris.  Climate change is already affecting the lives of many. We often forget, and open our eyes only when a natural disaster provokes a new wave of refugees. In fact, the current refugee crisis should force us to open our eyes on so many things: climate, economic imbalances, conflicts. All these are issues we can only address together, in partnership.  Over the past months, we have done a lot to save the lives of migrants and refugees, and to fight human smugglers. In the past weeks, you might have read a poem by a young British-Somali poet, Warsan Shire (which became popular thanks to actor Benedict Cumberbatch). It says ""no one puts children in the water, unless the water is safer than the land"". Our operation in the waters of the Mediterranean was named Sophia, after a baby who was born on one of our ships. This name, Sophia, is a reminder of what this is all about: hope, hope in a better future, hope in a safer future.  We are working to make the water safer. But we must also work to make the land safer. And this is something we can only do together. It can only be global effort  - an effort for peace, growth, human development. *****  This is a defining moment for who we are, and for our place in the world. A world which is more than ever interconnected, complex, and unpredictable. A world where internal and external policies are more intimately linked than ever. A world where volatile social media and short term emotions influence policy setting.  Such world needs leaders. Leaders, not strongmen. Leaders who are capable to listen and to build partnerships. I am sure that many of you have the talent and the vision to be that kind of leader. Luxembourg"

"Remarks of the HR/VP Federica Mogherini following her meeting with Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Vienna",29.10.2015,29.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5968_en,,"I just had a bilateral meeting with Minister Zarif. I believe it is very important that tomorrow, here in Vienna, we will have all the relevant actors, both regionally and internationally, sitting around the same table trying to define a common space for the beginning of a political process to find a solution to the crisis in Syria. Let's see if the work we have done in coordination with the US, with Russia, in these days, in these weeks, allows us to open this political space and create the possibility for a follow-up for the begining of a process that can lead us to a political transition in Syria. That is the purpose of the meetings. I will have other bilateral meetings tonight as we are preparing the meeting tomorrow. Q. Are you anticipating a compromise from sides that are sitting at the table tomorrow? I believe it is already a relevant commitment, for all the sides to be here tonight and tomorrow, to come together, to accept to sit together. This is already a very relevant starting point that only one week ago it was difficult to anticipate. So I would  invite everybody to take this as a very relevant step that I think we need to protect and, as Secretary General Ban Ki-moon indicated, show some flexibility and allow this political space to grow and to bring results in a process that, if tomorrow things go rather well, can open up and then be followed by other meetings. Already the fact that we are gathering in this format is really a very significant breakthrough. Thank you. Vienna"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the Quartet Principals' meeting in Vienna,23.10.2015,23.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5978_en,,"Vienna, 23 October 2015  Check against delivery  I know you have been standing or sitting here all day so I'll be brief. I know that the main focus of the day has been Syria and I will say a few words about that as well, but let me say that we had a very good Quartet meeting on the situation in the Middle East.  First of all, you know that the European Union was very much insisting on revitalising the format using the Quartet as the framework for the Europeans to come together with our friends in the United States, in Russia and in the whole UN. To pass a united message to our Israeli and Palestinian friends in these moments of tension and violence on the ground, it has been extremely important to gather and unite the international community behind a strong message - an invitation to calm down the situation, to show restraint in leadership, to contain the rhetoric that could inflame easily not only the situation on the ground, but also in the whole region. Today we have a Joint Statement from the Quartet that as I have understood you have not seen yet, I can read it out for you: Quartet Principals' Statement, Vienna, October 23, 2015  In my talks yesterday with Prime Minister Netanyahu I have had from him the confirmation of his willingness to engage with our envoys and to receive them. I will pass the same message to President Abbas on Monday in Brussels. He will come and visit me and we will discuss the possibility of the visit of the Quartet envoys and also an agenda of concrete steps on the ground that can be implemented in the coming future, both in the West Bank and in Gaza.  Now let me also say that I had the chance of speaking with Secretary Kerry and with Minister Lavrov on Syria. We have all tried to coordinate and work in the same direction which is that of opening a political process, a political transition in Syria that can allow an inclusive process, a Syrian led-process, bringing an end to the conflict.  If you have questions I can take a couple of them.  Q: Will Iran be at the next meeting?  A: You know the European Union position, also stated officially in the European Union Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions - all relevant actors, regionally and internationally, should be involved. This is our commitment, this is our engagement. I have had personally long talks with Iranian delegations, high level Iranian delegations, especially after the deal we have negotiated here in Vienna. Our open channel with Iran is something we are using very actively in these days, and I hope that Iran can be part of this common end.  Q: On the situation on the ground in the Middle East?  A: I believe in the efforts that we are making together – and this is somehow new in this last year, you have not often seen Quartet meetings, Quartet Principals' meeting so often, the last meeting was just in New York a few weeks ago. The fact that the international community is first - united, second - clear in the messages, passing the same messages, coordinating and very actively engaged. I believe it is something that could give us hope, not optimism at this moment, because there is little optimism seeing the situation on the ground. Hope that the parties would listen to the needs to calm down and contain the situation, and to engage concretely and consistently with steps on the ground that instead of fuelling the violence would bring positive steps for the population. This is what the population needs, both in Israel and in Palestine. Concrete improvements for their security and their daily life. Not only in economic terms,  but also in political terms. This is the collective, united coordinated engagement of the international community. As we have shown with the Iranian deal, even if it is a completely different story, when the international community is determined and united, normally it is not impossible to reach results. So I hope that this is one of these cases.  Link to video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?sitelang=en&ref=I110947 Vienna"
"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the meeting with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, German Foreign Minister",22.10.2015,22.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5983_en,,"Check against delivery Thank you very much Frank [Steinmeier]. Let me start by saying how grateful I am for the chance to exchange views and coordinate at the beginning of my stay in Berlin. It will be a short stay this time as we have very similar agendas today, not only in terms of meetings, meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and meeting with Secretary Kerry later on, but also very similar, if not identical political agendas. I believe that the true essence of showing leadership in a European way is exactly this: putting all the national strengths of diplomacy and policy, I wouldn't say at the service, but in coordination with the European one. I would like to thank you personally for always doing that in an excellent way, always having the European perspective in your national initiatives and bringing that to our European table in a very effective and strong way. The main two points we discussed are the migration and the refugee crisis, also touching upon the preparations of the Leaders' Meeting on Sunday on the Western Balkans route. I also had the chance to brief Frank about the results of my recent visit to Addis Ababa and the preparations of the La Valletta Summit. It was also a good opportunity to hear from Frank about his recent visits in the Gulf, in the Middle East and Tehran; again, coordination is of essence if you want to pass strong, united and unified messages. But apart from that, the Middle East Peace Process, or the lack of Middle East Peace Process, and the Syrian crisis were the core of our talks. On the first issue, on the Middle East, we will both meet Prime Minister Netanyahu later on, separately. I am just heading there from here and I can announce here that tomorrow in Vienna we will have a Quartet Principals' Meeting, following up the one we had in New York at the margins of the UN General Assembly. So I will be there together with SOS Kerry and Minister Lavrov and the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General, to coordinate messages, to pass on a strong message to the parties to calm down the situation on the ground, to tackle the situation of the holy sites seriously and with restraint, to deescalate also the rhetoric and to try to start implementation on the ground of some positive steps that could lead to more confidence building. I know it sounds as a desperate agenda in these days, but I believe, and we share this: unless we manage to re-establish some common ground for positive developments, we can only expect negative developments to happen. Things don't change for the better by themselves, we need to on work on them diplomatically and this is why, I believe, the meeting tomorrow - and the meetings we are having today, preparing the ground for it – will be important in the sense of gathering the whole international community in a multilateral way to encourage and engage with the parties, to try to create better conditions on the ground, especially in Jerusalem, but also in the West Bank and Gaza. And when it comes to the Syrian crisis, again it has been an excellent opportunity to exchange and compare notes. We have both had talks in the last couple of weeks with different key actors in the region and not only in the region. And we are indeed - and I can say for myself for sure, but I know this is also true for you Frank - following up very seriously and in a very committed way the indications we shared with all our European Union friends and colleagues, and the Foreign Ministers meeting just a few weeks ago in Luxembourg, to engage seriously with the partners and with the regional actors, to try to start the political process and the transition process as soon as possible in parallel with the military activities that are going on, on the ground. I believe, that coordination in this sense with Secretary Kerry and with Foreign Minister Lavrov whom I will meet tomorrow in Vienna, with the regional actors – Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran – with whom the European Union has a specific role to play given the open channel we have after the reaching of the Iranian deal, is key: they are all going to be pushing in the same direction. This means opening the political transition, opening the political process and trying to find diplomatic solutions to the crisis. Things, as you see, are moving, on different levels, but hopefully in the same direction. And we will use these hours and days, today and tomorrow, to try to see if these different moves on different levels can initiate something useful in that direction. Q&A 1) What do you hope and wish for from the Palestinians and from PM Netanyahu? Are you referring to contractual agreements on the use of the Temple Mount, or does it mean more? 2) On the meeting tomorrow: who is attending; what outcome are you expecting; why is FM Steinmeier not attending; HRVP will be there, right? The meeting tomorrow in Vienna - the one I am going to participate to, apart from bilateral meetings that will happen at the margins - is the Quartet Principals. The Quartet on the Middle East Peace Process is the UN, the EU, the US and Russia. This has always been the case, so there was never a discussion to enlarge it to Germany. But it is true; we had in New York an enlarged version of the Quartet, where we invited some key Arab countries and some European – and not only European - friends to join to create an international environment to accompany this process but this is the Quartet itself. So, the format is well established. And I have to say the European Union itself and I have personally invested a lot in revitalizing the work with the Quartet that in the last years was, let's say, not necessarily very proactive. Since I started my mandate, I decided with the full support of my European Union colleagues to revitalize the format as a very effective multilateral format to tackle the crisis in the Middle East. And, reaching out, proactively to three key countries in the region, namely, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, especially with the three links, I would say: the role of Egypt in Gaza strip, the role of Saudi Arabia for what it concerns the Arab Peace Initiative and the role of Jordan, we see it very clearly in these days, regarding the holy sites. And let me add something I forgot to mention before. Tomorrow I will also meet the Jordanian Foreign Minister in Vienna and I am planning to meet President Abbas in Brussels in the coming days. Expectations: briefly, this is a question that we can really answer maybe at the end of this day of consultations rather than now. But the main objective is, first of all, to calm down at least the rhetoric of the leaderships. Because the paradox of the Middle East Peace Process and the situation between Israel and Palestine is that being one of the oldest conflicts we are dealing with, it is also one of the few for which the final outcome, the final settlement is more or less understood by everybody and it is a matter of political leadership, political will and support internally on the different sides to achieve this. My impression sometimes is that the parties don't realise that today compared to decades ago the regional security situation is different and it is much more dangerous to leave this conflict unsolved. What we see in the holy sites risks to inflame the whole region and far beyond, from Indonesia to Chile, there is not one single meeting - I am sure it happens the same to you - where the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not mentioned. In these times, solving that conflict, showing restraint, calming down the rhetoric, not mixing the political side with the historical or with the cultural or with the religious one is the only way we have to bring a little bit of rationality in the management of this.

Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following her meetings on the latest tensions in the Middle East,22.10.2015,22.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5982_en,,"Berlin, 22 October 2015 I am happy to debrief you on my meetings today here in Berlin, indeed a diplomatic capital of the day. I have started with a meeting with Minister Steinmeier, where we coordinated messages. First of all we spoke about our recent visits. He has been in crucial visit to the Middle East and it was agreed among us that he would have debriefed me coming back, namely from his talks in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, mainly on the Syrian crisis. I told him about my recent Africa trips, focused on the migration and refugee crises, which was relevant to share; I was in Addis Ababa, meeting the African Union just at the beginning of the week. So first of all we exchanged notes and coordinated messages in view of the meetings today on the Middle East Peace Process and on Syria. We had a press conference earlier today so I will not repeat what we already said. My next meeting was with Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. The last time we met was in New York, just a few weeks ago, and since then we have had several telephone conversations as the situation was escalating on the ground, in Jerusalem and elsewhere. I passed him a message of the need to explore together ways to stop violence, to calm down the situation, to show leadership and restraint, also on the rhetoric, and make sure that there are not additional people losing their lives. Too many people have lost their lives already in this new wave of violence on both sides, both Israelis and Palestinians. I have stressed the need to do that, not only for the sake of the people in the region, on the ground, but also given the regional and global responsibility that the two leaderships have as the conflict concentrates on the holy sites. This risks inflaming the situation regionally and even potentially globally - whenever a conflict overlaps with the regional dimension, with an identity dimension, that turns very easily into something very dangerous for the international community as such. This means that showing leadership and acting with a certain degree of restraint is not only a responsibility the two leaderships have to their own people, but also to the regional and the international communities. We discussed concrete ways to deescalate the situation on the ground and to guarantee the status quo in the holy sites. I had from him the clear commitment reaffirming that he wants to guarantee the status quo in the holy sites and this is something I am going to discuss in detail with the Jordanian Foreign Minister tomorrow in Vienna. As you know Jordan has a key role to play in guaranteeing the status quo of the holy sites. We also discussed concrete steps to implement on the ground - consistent with prior agreements - that could move the situation on the ground, especially in Gaza and West Bank, in Jerusalem, both on the economic and on the security level. These are things we have discussed already in New York the last Quartet meeting we had, in the margins of General Assembly. These are things we have discussed with PM Netanyahu and with President Abbas, I discussed personally with them, in New York, it's only two weeks ago, but it seems decades ago in terms of situation on the ground. We remain convinced - and this is the message I passed to him - that while we find ways or we look for ways to deescalate violence on the ground we have to start implementing measures on the ground, consistent with prior agreements, to have improvements for the population, both the Israeli and the Palestinian. This could be part of a political process that needs to be re-started. At the same time as we look for concrete ways to de-escalate, we have to give perspectives on the political process. It is not phase one and phase two, the two have to go together even more now than before. Without a political horizon, the situation is not going to calm down. This is something we will further discuss tomorrow in Vienna, where we will have a Quartet Principals' meeting, as a follow-up to the New York one. So, with me, Secretary Kerry, Minister Lavrov and the Secretary General of the United Nations will join us most likely through video conference, or his Special Envoy will represent him. Let me add that I will have a similar meeting with President Abbas on Monday evening in Brussels and obviously I will raise with him the same kind of issues. And I believe the meeting of the Quartet tomorrow will be a very important moment for us to indicate the unity of the international community to work together with the parties to find concrete ways to de-escalate and contain the situation and at the same time re-launch the process. Finally, last but not least, I had a meeting with John Kerry, US Secretary of State, to somehow compare notes of our respective meetings. On one side, on the Middle East Peace Process, preparing also the Quartet of tomorrow, and coordinating actions we can have on the ground. And also on Syria, in preparation of the meeting he will have tomorrow in Vienna with Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. I exchanged with him the main results, or findings or thoughts after the work I have done in the last weeks on the Syrian crisis, mainly with our counterparts in Iran, also in Turkey and in the Gulf. I will have tomorrow a meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov also discussing this, both Middle East and Syria. But with John Kerry we also discussed the situation in Libya. That is something that concerns us Europeans very much and also our American friends. I called today the Prime Minister Designate for an exchange of views on the situation in this moment. Strong push for the HOR and the GNC to endorse the agreement, and I guaranteed to the Prime Minister Designate the European Union's support in his difficult work. He will have the Europeans at his side, in all the ways in which the future Libyan Government will decide it is needed. So, in full partnership, in full coordination, but they have to know from now that we are ready to help, to support, to accompany on an agenda that they will have to define. Obviously, the situation is not there yet, we don't have the agreement yet, but the Prime Minister Designate has already a responsibility to reach out to the Libyans, to the parties, to start planning and building the possible future of the country while talks go on. We are fully engaged through our people on the ground in Tunis, working side by side with Bernardino León and with the others of the international community to push for an agreement to be finalised and the Government of National Accord to start work. So, I had a very good first exchange with the Prime Minister Designate on the way forward, and I am looking forward to be able to meet him as soon as possible. Questions and Answers Q: Do you that the Iran contact group is the right format to discuss and solve the crisis in Syria as well? The second one is on Assad, after he has been invited to Moscow and returned do you think it is now the time, the right step to offer him asylum? The format for Syria. First of all, let me say that the format we used for Iran talks was a very useful one and was a format that allowed us to gather the whole international community, united, and created also a certain sense of confidence and trust among the negotiators, which is not something easy to do, but it was a relevant part of the process. And the role of the European Union in dealing with the Syrian crisis somehow has to do with the role that we have played, and I have personally played, in the last months with Iran, in the sense that we have a channel that is open with Iran that is unique. We have opened the channel of dialogue, not yet of friendship probably, but of understanding - of mutual understanding - and a certain degree of trust in the negotiations that we have put at the disposal of the international community. This is quite unique, I say, because again having led negotiations for so long, in the European Union there is a sense of confidence that we have already used. In these last weeks while I was receiving in Brussels an Iranian delegation, a High Level Delegation, that spent one whole day in Brussels discussing with us possible ways out of the Syrian crisis. Obviously, Iran is one of the actors relevant to solve the crisis in Syria. It's not the only one, but it's a relevant one: for the contacts it has with the regime, for the presence it has and for the regional dimension of the crisis. So for sure, the role that the European Union is playing in trying to solve the crisis in Syria passes also through our role in the dialogue with Iran. On the format itself, this is in the hands of the United Nations, as you know, negotiations are formally led by the UN Special Envoy Staffan De Mistura. It will be in their hands to define a format when the time will come, to have a format in place. My impression is that at the moment it is not really the time for focussing on the format, but rather on the content of a possible framework for negotiations. And very much on having a political process starting, while at this moment we see mainly the military side of the activities going on. Our efforts as the European Union in these weeks are focused on the push and the need to have a political process, a political transition starting as soon as possible. On the possibility for Assad to have a life somewhere else in the world, this is not for me neither to comment nor to foresee options. What we are working at is a political transition, this is very much based on the Geneva communiqué that was foreseeing a Syrian-led transition, an inclusive one. Because I think we have learnt from the Iraqi lessons that we need to guarantee that political processes and transitions need to guarantee not only the safety, but also the inclusiveness of all components of societies in the process. And this is what we are working at, so a transition where for sure Assad is and will be part of the starting point. This is the reality we are facing in these days. And this is also the reality that the Geneva communiqué that everybody is accepting as a starting point foresees. But obviously, the name itself, a political transition, foresees a move from one kind of governance to a different one. And this is what we are working at. Q: I have two questions: The first is that Steinmeier was very specific about Syria and the role of Russia and said that the role of Russia and Syria has worsened the situation of the refugees. I wonder if you share this opinion. And, the second question is on Israel. You spoke this morning and now about the awareness that we need have to have from the leaders in Israel that this is a very inflammable region. Do you have this impression, speaking with Netanyahu as he came here yesterday to Berlin and after he said those things about the Holocaust and the responsibility of Palestine? I have the impression that Prime Minister Netanyahu has the awareness of how inflammable the situation is; of how inflammable the situation is not only in the West Bank, in Jerusalem, in Gaza, all around in the region - as I said this morning in the press conference with Minister Steinmeier, also worldwide, but also inside Israel. So, yes, I have found him very much aware of this, very much worried about this and open to find ways of trying to de-escalate the situation, calm down the situation, contain the situation and start having positive steps. And let me recognize that in some aspects, he is showing leadership, also respect, to his internal political situation, in for instance resisting in these times to the request that he is having from parts of the political system in Israel to announce new settlements in response to the circle of violence. I think that he is aware of the fact that there is the need to show leadership and restraint and calm down the situation. On the Russian role, I agree with Minister Steinmeier on the fact that the military, let's say, the step up of the military activities on the ground might have and might lead to a worsened situation for the people inside Syria and more waves of refugees coming out of Syria. On the other side, we also agree with Minister Steinmeier on the fact that the military part of the fight against Da'esh is something essential, given that it is coordinated and really targeted against Da'esh and actually a precondition somehow for having a stabilized and peaceful Syria. We have Syrian refugees coming out of Syria for two main reasons: we can argue for a long time which one is the first one but everybody agrees on the fact that there are two components of the crisis. Obviously, the attacks of the Syrian regime itself against their own people, but also the activities of Da'esh against the population, the Syrian population. So, the military component is for sure one part of it, if it is one part and the only part of it and not coordinated with the rest of the international community. Obviously this is a dangerous situation. But let me say that we also shared with Minister Steinmeier today the fact that if Russia engages the regime - as well as the Iranians can do - pushing them to start or be part of the political process, be ready to participate in the beginning of a political process or political transition, this is going to be positive. Q: Thank you. You have already answered my question. You share what Kerry said that he showed optimism about the solution after his dialogue with Netanyahu? I am very well known for being always an optimist in my approach. In this case optimism is maybe a little bit too much. But I found, as I said, a high level of awareness of how serious and dangerous the situation is. First of all, for Israel and the Israeli citizens. And so, a will to engage in the efforts to find a solution and contribute to getting things solved. And again, starting from the most critical issue today, which is the situation of the holy sites. That is why I believe it is going to be key and crucial for us to have talks with the Jordanians in these coming hours and days at different levels. I think it is extremely good that today we had the chance to coordinate messages because we were also joking with the Prime Minister Netanyahu today that we are the same people meeting the same people. What we have done today is a very good exercise of coordinating messages and also a sort of labour division of who is going to do what with whom. So in the end of the day, we have a complete picture that puts the international community in the position to push in the same direction. Optimism is too much, but I don’t go away from Berlin with a sense of negative meetings at all. On the contrary, with some hope that we can work on something positive. I will see if this hope is realistic also in the talks I will have tomorrow in Vienna and then on Monday with Abbas. Q: I want to ask something about Sunday. There were some criticisms that not all EU countries have been invited for this Balkan refugee, not summit, but meeting on refugees. Do you have a problem with that?  Do you see that there is a danger of splitting the EU in tackling the refugee crisis? Here I put my hat of Vice-President of the Commission, as you know it's President Juncker's initiative to call to Brussels some of the leaders, not only of the European Union, but also non-European Union leaders with a very precise and limited point on the agenda which is the management of the flows through the Western Balkans. It is quite evident that we have – let's say – some difficulties in managing especially the borders and I know this is the focus of the meeting to have the relevant players concerned by the management of the borders and the flows across the Western Balkans and the Western Balkan route sitting around the same table, with the European agencies responsible for that, EASO and Frontex, and with the UNHCR when it comes to the protection of the refugees and the standards for the protection for refugees. I think it is in President Juncker's intention to have the players involved - those whose borders are concerned. This is my reading of the format, which is not creating precedents, which is not a Summit, as you said. And in fact, it is called by the President of the Commission, not of the Council, because this is work on which the Commission has engaged, and has institutional responsibilities. It has very much to do with Schengen/non-Schengen functioning and I think it is only pragmatic to have the countries involved in the border management sitting around the table to look  - this is something we are preparing in these hours - at ways to manage the flow across the borders in a proper, coordinated way. We had the European Council just one week ago, and we discussed this point together with the rest of the preparation we are doing for the Malta Summit, for instance on the Southern route and our relationship and partnership with Africa. We are having our discussions with Turkey and other players, all together, because these are issues that are relevant for 28 Member States and for the European institutions as a whole, but when it comes to border management of some particular cases I believe that is the reading you should get. It is not about discussing with some subjects that relate to all, it's getting the relevant players that have some difficulties around the table with the relevant agencies of the European Union, finding ways to solve the problems where they occur, that's it. And the Balkans, we know very well it's concrete and practical, but it is also another easily inflammable place. So there is a specific European Commission responsibility, also looking at the enlargement negotiations and the use of our instruments in the region, to make sure that the situation doesn't get out of control and manages to be managed in a cooperative spirit - the EU and non-EU states, because you know some non-EU states will be sitting around the table as well. Q: Has there been a lack of leadership during the last weeks (regarding Netanyahu and Abbas)? I think that both PM Netanyahu and President Abbas - and they don't like me referring to both in this way, because the situation in the societies is very different - have one thing in common, which is that they both have extremely difficult or challenging, complex situations, domestic and political situations, and violence doesn't make easy. The starting point, even without violence, is internally domestically complex, for completely different reasons. But the starting point is this - political domestic environment for both is challenging for different reasons. And I believe that especially in the Middle East, where the final solution, the final setting of the crisis has been discussed for decades, it's not so much about that, but it's more political leadership and conditions on the ground to exercise that leadership, political space in their respective public opinions to bring the agenda, once we would have set the peace agenda, forward. I believe that the international community and our European role in particular, is to help and to support the two leaderships in re-creating or creating the internal conditions in their own public opinions to exercise leadership and bring the societies to a point where they invest in a process again. These conditions are not there today. So, I think they have a very difficult job in showing leadership and exercising leadership. With some significant gaps, particularly sometimes on the rhetoric, but they are both trying, I think, to show restraint and calm. But I would not go for the blame and shame, I would rather go for the encouragement, because I believe we all understand very well that their conditions, especially with violence rising, are extremely difficult. The role of Europe for sure is to help and support a process that can make public opinions, both on the Palestinian side and on the Israeli side wanting to re-engage in a process.

"Speech by Commissioner Jourová on behalf of the High Representative/ Vice President, Federica Mogherini, to the European Parliament on 14 October 2015 on the Situation in Ukraine",16.10.2015,16.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5833_en,,"Check against delivery Let me thank you for this opportunity to discuss the situation in Ukraine with the European Parliament. Much attention has been given to other pressing problems lately, but Ukraine remains a top priority for the EU. We must not underestimate what is at stake. First and foremost, it is human lives. The latest numbers are appalling: almost 8000 people killed, 1.5 million displaced and another 1.1 million have left the country since the start of the conflict. Second, basic principles of international law have been challenged: territorial integrity, sovereignty and the inviolability of borders – cornerstones of the European security order. Crimea and Sevastopol have been illegally annexed by the Russian Federation. I want to thank the EP for keeping Ukraine high on the agenda. The interparliamentary meetings, the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding between the EP and the Rada on parliamentary support and capacity building and recent visits to Ukraine by the JURI, INTA, DROI and AFET committees are just a few examples. In less than two weeks, some of you will travel to Ukraine to monitor the local elections – another opportunity for the Ukrainian people to exercise their democratic rights. All of this strengthens EU-Ukraine relations. Your role cannot be overestimated. The EP has ratified the Association Agreement a bit more than a year ago, paving the way towards an  era of new opportunities for citizens in Ukraine, based on its political association and economic integration with the European Union. During the last plenary debate on Ukraine in February, you discussed at length the Normandy format and the Minsk Agreements. HRVP stressed then that the diplomatic efforts led by Germany and France are genuinely European, and that we must remain united in our support of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group in order to achieve results. A lot has happened since then. During spring and summer, the situation on the ground deteriorated. Nevertheless, Ukraine has adopted decentralization-related amendments to the constitution in the first reading. This includes a provision enabling special arrangements for self-government in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in line with the Minsk Agreements. Since 1 September, following intense diplomatic efforts, the ceasefire, which was first agreed in September 2014, is finally being largely respected. Two weeks ago, an agreement was reached on the withdrawal of tanks and smaller weapons, the implementation of which has already begun. The EU-supported OSCE SMM is growing further to its full strength of 1000 monitors on the ground to cope with all new tasks of verification and monitoring. We know however that it is not the number of monitors only but above all their full access to the territory which can make a real difference. That is why we emphasise the need for it strongly. Demining on both sides of the LoC (line of contact) has started. The Normandy summit of 2 October gave further impetus to the political process and the separatist so-called elections in Luhansk and Donetsk – which would have violated Minsk – have now been deferred. Does this mean that the conflict is almost over? Clearly not. Cases of shooting and shelling still take place, people continue to die. IDPs are unable to return to their homes. The modalities of the local elections according to OSCE standards still need to be fixed under Ukrainian law. The special arrangement for self-government has to be agreed and an amnesty implemented. There should be no Russian forces on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine should regain control over the 450-km long segment of its border that it has been forced to abandon. Nevertheless, what we do have now is a process that is moving in the right direction, albeit slowly and sometimes hesitantly. This is no small thing. The joint support of EU institutions and member states to this process has certainly contributed substantially. The EU will continue to support the process, including through financial and in-kind contributions to the OSCE special monitoring mission. Also, the EU and its Member States have contributed over 242 million euro in humanitarian and recovery aid, including 42 million provided by the Commission to all affected populations, including refugees in Russia and Belarus. In parallel, the Commission engages in trilateral talks on energy and DCFTA implementation. They ensure that gas supplies to and through Ukraine remain uninterrupted during the winter season. They also address Russia's concerns about the DCFTA without amending or delaying the implementation of the agreement from 1 January onwards. Ladies and gentlemen, EU relations with Ukraine develop dynamically despite the difficult realities of the conflict its authorities and above all its people have to face. Our goal remains to help them  create a well-functioning state and a successful economy. Just a few examples: • The Support Group for Ukraine continues to focus EU advice, technical assistance and financial resources on the Ukrainian reform process. Over 6 billion of the original 11 billion euro support package announced by the EU in March 2014 has already been mobilised to launch the reforms that will secure its future. • The EU Advisory Mission to Ukraine is doing important work to assist security sector reforms. Its mandate is currently under review to further streamline its activities toward Ukraine's most immediate needs. • On Visa Liberalization, we are moving towards the goal of visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens to the EU, an important step to enhance people-to-people contacts. Further progress is needed notably in the fight against corruption. To sum up, we have reason to be cautiously optimistic about progress on the diplomatic track if we remain united. And we will continue to support Ukraine on its path to becoming a prosperous country. These are our joint objectives, and I look forward to working towards them together. Bruxelles"
Doorstep remarks by High Representative / Vice-President Federica Mogherini ahead of the weekly European Commission College meeting,14.10.2015,14.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5832_en,,"Check against delivery Good morning. Tomorrow, we will bring the work we have done on the external part of our strategy on refugees and migration on the European Council's table.  I have in these months, worked on different levels.  On one side, we have started the High level dialogues with the main countries of origin and transit. First of all North African ones, notably Niger, which is a key country. I am going on Monday to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to have discussions at the highest level, with the African Union and obviously with the country itself. We will launch a high level dialogue on migration also with them in preparation for the Malta summit in November. On the Eastern Route, we have also organised High level conference on the Western Balkans and the Eastern Route and launched High level dialogues with Turkey. I had exchanges with the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Lebanon, Jordan, and others. Most of all, we have decided with the Foreign Ministers just a few days ago, to increase our diplomatic work on the solution of the crisis in Syria. I have received just yesterday an Iranian delegation, who spent the whole day here in Brussels, starting to work with us on possible ways to launch a political process, in parallel with the work that Staffan de Mistura is doing currently. Yesterday, he was in Moscow and then travelling to Washington DC. We are coordinating our efforts to reach out to all the international and regional players and try to have a beginning of the political transition, starting as soon as possible. We have also had talks in this respect with Russia, with Foreign Minister Lavrov, and with the US, Secretary Kerry and we continue to work in this direction. I would, say, tomorrow, what we bring in the European Council is an external action on migration and refugee crisis that has delivered on the tasks that were given to me by the Council and that were included in the programme of the Commission. Obviously, we don't solve crises and wars from one day to the other. But the work is well on track,  Europe is on this united and I am extremely engaged and active on that. Q: On the role of Russia. The role of Russia could be extremely important. We all agree, also with Russia, that we need to invest a lot in the UN-led process and that is why the talks that Staffan de Mistura held yesterday in Moscow are very important in this respect. Russia is, and can be, a key player, when it comes to putting pressure or convincing the regime in Syria to participate to the political process, to the talks, to sit around the table, just as the role of Iran is crucial in this respect. If we want the political situation to move inside Syria, and the political process to start immediately, we need to involve the actors that have an influence, a direct influence on the regime. And that is why both Russia and Iran are crucial. Obviously, we also need to involve the other key regional powers, starting from Turkey and the Gulf countries, starting from Saudi Arabia, to create a framework that puts together the main international actors: the EU, Russia, the US, and the main regional actors, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, so that we have all the internal Syrian actors committed to a political process. This is what we are working at. Q: Sur la possibilité d'avancer vue la situation sur le terrain Je pense que, au contraire, l'état de fait sur le plan militaire en Syrie, rend même plus urgent, le début, le commencent d'un processus politique. Tout le monde se rend bien compte - les européens sans aucun doute - qu'il n'y a pas de voie militaire à la solution de la crise. Il faut que, en parallèle avec l'engagement militaire contre Da'esh, il y ait aussi, assez vite, le début d'un processus politique. Les deux vont ensemble. C'est ce que nous avons  discuté et le fait sur lequel nous sommes d'accord, dans l'Union européenne. Les deux processus vont ensemble, doivent aller ensemble. Q: Sur la discussion demain avec les Chef d'Etats et sur le rôle d'Assad Je pense que la discussion que nous avons eue avec les Ministres des Affaires Etrangères lundi est une très bonne base pour la discussion au Conseil européen qui aura lieu demain. J'emmènerai au Conseil les résultats, les conclusions, que nous avons adoptées lundi à Luxembourg avec les Ministres des Affaires Etrangères, sur la Syrie notamment, mais aussi sur la Libye et sur le côté extérieur de notre stratégie sur les réfugiés et la migration. Je parlerai également aujourd'hui avec le Président Donald Tusk pour préparer le Conseil européen de demain. Je pense que nous sommes tous d'accord sur le fait qu'il est impossible d'imaginer que Bashar Al-Assad fasse partie de la future gouvernance du pays après quatre ans et demi de guerre civile. D'un autre côté, il faut démarrer une transition politique avec tout le monde de représenté autour de la table des négociations. C'est le travail que nous sommes en train de faire, notamment dans le cadre du processus mené par l'envoyé spécial des Nations Unis Staffan de Mistura. Q: Why does the EU legitimize dictatorial regimes like Eritrea by cooperating with them? We never legitimise any dictatorial regime, we are always putting human rights and our standards and our principles on the table first. We need to tackle the root causes, we always say. Among the root causes there is also respect of human rights, participatory democracy and societies that are inclusive. This is always on the table whenever we engage with leaderships wherever in the World. Thank you!  Watch the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I110409 Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council,12.10.2015,12.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3126_en,," Check against delivery Today on the agenda there are only a few points, but crucial ones. We will start obviously with an issue that is not on the agenda: the attacks that occurred in Ankara few days ago. It is very clear that the European Union and Turkey share now more than ever a common agenda when it comes to security and stability of the region, but also peace in the region - which is a word that we don't use anymore but we should put on the agenda again very strongly. On top of that, there is another element that is not going to be on our agenda this time but for sure will come back again - and we discussed a lot about that in New York just few days ago - which is the situation in Jerusalem, West Bank and Gaza. I had yesterday night phone calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. I will update the ministers of these talks and of the ongoing efforts that the European Union is taking together with the rest of the Quartet to contain the situation, to bring back calm and to restart a political process. What we have on the agenda today is Libya, Syria and the issue of migration. Three things that are somehow interlinked but different in nature. On Libya, the common message that I expect we will deliver united, as Europeans today with the ministers, is a strong call for all the Libyan parties to endorse the final plan that is on the table. They have an incredible opportunity to unite the country and bring back some security and stability for the Libyan people that, I believe, deserve it after so many years of difficult situation on the ground. We have already planned all our possible support that will be needed and we are ready to discuss with the new Libyan authorities once the government starts. On Syria, we will have Council conclusions that I expect to be consensual and unanimous on the united European support to the work that UN is doing in difficult conditions to try to start a political transition in the country. So apart from the humanitarian efforts we are doing - the European Union is the first donor as you know -, apart from the military dimension against Da'esh that is very evident in these days and the military complications around that, and we will discuss that, I think most of all the European contribution can be on the political process that we need to start for finding a real solution to the crisis. We will also discuss migration as we have already and regularly done in the last six, seven months, while putting together all the things that the European Union is doing on the external side. This will feed into the discussion of the European Council later this week, like the internal side has been prepared by the Interior Ministers last week. On the Russian intervention in Syria. I guess it is much more complicated than just saying ""positive"" or ""negative"". It is for sure a game changer. It has some very worrying elements. We will discuss them, in particular when it comes to the violation of the airspace of Turkey. I have always said, and I believe this is going to be also the outcome of today, interventions against Da'esh have to be clearly against Da'esh and other terrorist groups, as defined by the UN. We have a common ground, I believe, the EU, the US, Russia, all of us we have a common ground, which is the Security Council Resolutions that we have already passed and the UN framework. And it has to be coordinated; otherwise it risks being extremely dangerous, not only from a political point of view, but mainly from a military point of view. On possibility of restarting a dialogue with Assad. When we say ""support to the UN"" - and to the UN process -, we also say that this support goes to a process that has to have all the actors around the table. The UN is doing this effort, this exercise. I am in daily contact with Staffan De Mistura, I also talked to him yesterday and we - everybody that has a say, that has a role in the crisis and in the transition - are going to put our diplomatic efforts in support of his efforts in this direction. The outcome of the transition will be defined together with the international community, the regional players but most of all by the Syrians.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference after the Foreign Affairs Council,12.10.2015,12.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3123_en,,"Check against delivery Thank you very much. I guess that by now you have been debriefed by the Ministers coming out of the Council and also I guess that you had the chance of having a look at the Council conclusions we have adopted, on the three issues that were on our agenda today. An agenda that was focused very much on the top priorities of the international agenda. First, Migration, with a view to feed in the preparation of the European Council that is going to discuss this issue again next Thursday. We adopted Council conclusions on the external part of our action on migration, having a comprehensive view of all the things that have been done as we were tasked in previous meetings of the European Council, or in the European Agenda on migration. In the Council conclusions on migration, you find all the things that have been followed up in these months on an operational side: on the Eastern route and on the Southern route at the same time, giving  the same level of importance to both; and also taking stock of the results of the Western Balkans Conference that was held here last week as well as the preparation for the Malta Summit in November. We discussed with the Ministers today the way forward to further implementation of these decisions. On the other two points on the agenda, Libya and Syria: it reflects somehow the need we often refer to, to tackle part of the root causes of the refugee crisis and the migration crisis. Not the only ones obviously, but we know very well that conflicts and crises around us are one of the main reasons for instability that lead to this huge movement of people through Libya in the case of Mediterranean route and from Syria in the case of the Eastern route. When it comes to our discussion on Libya, Ministers often discussed this issue since I started my mandate almost one year ago. We have started a preparation, with a certain sense of anticipation, already in the beginning of the year to prepare what kind of support the European Union can provide to a Government of National Accord once it is formed. Today, the main point was, and is, to pass a strong and united message from the European Union and the Member States all together, to all the Libyan parties in these crucial hours, to invite all of them to endorse the agreement that is on their table for the sake of the Libyan people first of all, and the country. We are ready, as we have stated several times, to give all the possible support that the Libyans would require and ask for, in a spirit of partnership. We have prepared a certain number of options on different kind of support being it on basic services, municipalities, health, border control, and on the migration flow - not necessarily on the sea border, but also and mainly on the land borders, meaning the Southern border of Libya. A whole series of issues, including the counterterrorism work against Da'esh, on which the European Union, as such, is united and ready to support,  but obviously that we need to discuss with the new Libyan authorities once a government is formed in a true sense of partnership. The main message today from all the 28 Foreign Ministers and from me personally, is a plea to the Libyans, all the Libyans, to unite and give their country a chance to get out of the chaos they have been experiencing in the last years. On Syria, we had a long discussion. It was not the first one in recent times, as we dedicated our Foreign Ministers informal meeting in New York, in the margins of the General Assembly of the United Nations, to discuss this together with UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura. Somehow we have built on this informal discussion to shape our common position today.  I often hear, that on Syria in particular, Europe is divided, so I guess the news today is that ""Europe is united"" on a common stance, on our role, to trying to facilitate a political solution to the crisis on three elements. On one side, the humanitarian aspects. As you know, the European Union is the first donor and is continuing to be. We are increasing the level of our contributions, not only to cover projects inside Syria that are going on in very difficult circumstances, but also and mainly to the neighbouring countries. We are determined to increase the level of our humanitarian assistance. And we also have two other tracks, highlighted in the Council conclusions we have adopted unanimously today. On one side, the security track:  the European Union as such, and the Member States, are engaged within the global coalition against Da'esh. Not only against Da'esh, let me also mention the other terrorist organisations that are defined as terrorist organisations by the UN Security Council resolutions, and in particular al-Nusra. But the European Union itself is not involved in the military activities. We are participating in the coalition with complementary activities that contribute to the fight against Da'esh and terrorist organisations, and to the efforts to stabilise not only the situation in Syria, but also the fight against these entities in Iraq. Our main focus today was the one on the political track. Because, if there is a huge political space for EU to play a role, it is to actively, efficiently, pro-actively, support  the UN-led process. Let me be very clear on this. There are two ways of supporting a UN process. There is a neutral, easy way. No one normally argues that UN processes are not worth supporting, but there is a sort of distance. So, the UN is doing its work and we support it. We decided today to mean it. So, when we write full political weight, full diplomatic weight from the European Union to back and to support actively and efficiently the UN-led process, that means that from tonight onwards, we will work hand in hand with UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura on starting the political process leading to a transition. This is what we have discussed obviously with Staffan de Mistura in these days. We are going to engage or to reach out to different regional powers, involved in or that can have an influence in solving the conflict. I will receive tomorrow morning a visit by an Iranian delegation in Brussels, with whom we will start discussions on this. This will take place at the same time as Staffan de Mistura will be meeting Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on the same issue. We have decided to coordinate our actions very closely, and to do a little bit what the European Union has done in these recent months on Libya with the UN-led process led by Bernandino Leon: active, daily, common work, support to have the political process not only kept as an objective, but also started. Starting a process leading to a political transition is even more urgent now that the security situation is deteriorating on the ground. There is sufficient unity within the European Union to allow us to play a significant facilitating role at the side of the UN to facilitate the transition that can involve all the relevant actors inside Syria, in the region and in the broader international community. This is what we are going to do. Questions and Answers On Syria and engaging with Al-Assad When I say, and when we say in the conclusions, that it is the UN that has to lead the process - and is leading the process - we mean that it is for the UN to run some of the talks and for us to run others. We will do some of them jointly. I don't exclude that, in the near future, UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura and myself might have joint meetings with some of the actors in the region or internationally. UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, and the UN in general, are talking with the Syrian regime, and this is something that we can support in the context of our support to the UN-led process. When we talk about the need to start urgently a political process leading to a transition, it means that we have to have a reality check. We have to understand that 4,5 years after the beginning of the conflict, the situation on the ground is still the one of having Assad sitting in Damascus and terrorist organisations, in particular Da'esh, gaining ground in Syria, and also in Iraq. So, the reality check means that it is not more of the same that is going to lead to the political process to start and to end with a transition, but we need to have a different kind of approach, which means involving also representatives of the regime at the negotiating table led by the UN. On the EU mandate in Syria; and on the EU's work with Russia. On the mandate: actually the Council conclusions recall a previous mandate I received already in July. If you look at the Council conclusions we adopted at the end of July regarding the Iranian deal, there was already a reference to that precise tasking to me: ""to explore ways of building more constructive and cooperative regional dynamics."" I am going to do it. I had already started to fulfil that mandate in the last months. Obviously first with Iran. We have played a role of mediation during the nuclear talks that can give us sufficient confidence from their side to have open talks with us, also on this issue. This is going to be the first step we are going to take. Then we will also engage with the Gulf countries, starting with Saudi Arabia. I visited Riyadh already in the end of July with exactly the same purpose- to explore possibilities to build a more cooperative regional dynamic.  Having different kinds of relationships between the regional powers in the Middle East that can lead to decreased tensions and conflicts in the area is clearly in the European interest, because it is also an area that is very close geographically to us. I have had in New York, in the margins of the General Assembly, talks with both the Saudi Foreign Minister, but also with all the other GCC countries' Foreign Ministers precisely on this. We are following that up, both at my level but also at senior official's level. I would add a third element that I would explore, as a result of my mandate in the region, which is the one of Turkey. Turkey is a country that has a clear important regional dimension, a clear regional power. We tend to refer to Turkey in these days and in these weeks, mainly in relation with the refugee crisis. But what we need with Turkey is mainly a high-level foreign policy and political dialogue also on the balance in the region and on the crisis in Syria. The discussion we can have, as we have started last week, with Turkish authorities on the way forward to find a political solution on the Syrian crisis is going to be very relevant. Turkey is one of the countries with whom, as the European Union, we have intense contacts and many interests that we share. We are used to exchange intensively and very often for different reasons. Turkey is going to be  one of the key actors with which I am going to work to explore these regional possibilities. When it comes to Russia, I believe that on one side - you find it on the Council conclusions-  there is some worries on the fact that military activities might either be not targeted against Da'esh or other UN recognised terrorist organisations and on the other side not coordinated with other actors that are playing a military role in the area, which is something dangerous in itself. But on the other side, I have to underline  that very few of you, if any at all, have noticed that reference to the role that Russia can play in exercising a sort of involvement of the regime in the political process itself; that is going to be a very significant and important role that Russia can play. I believe that, in parallel to the work that the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura is doing with them, we, as the European Union, can engage directly with Russia to see if a political process can start, guaranteeing that everybody sits around the table for defining the political process that will lead to a transition. But first of all, we need to start the process. And for doing so, the role of the regional actors as well as the role of the United States and of Russia are going to be crucial. I discussed this with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York during our last bilateral meeting. I discussed it again recently with the Russian ambassador to Brussels a few days ago and we will discuss it again the next time we will meet. So, direct engagements with Russia on this, seeing the opportunity for Russia to be a relevant actor to start the political process. On Turkish calls for safe zones. And on NATO's role in Libya and the region. We have discussed the issue of safe zones first of all with our Turkish friends but also with our American partners and obviously here today with the Ministers. I have to say that my personal impression is that the developments of the last days, weeks or so, and especially the increase of military activities in precisely that part of Northern Syria, might make the plans that our Turkish friends were elaborating relatively in need for readjustment. Because the situation on the ground is moving fast and the idea of somehow creating safe zones exactly in the area where Da'esh is concentrated and the Russian military presence is concentrated might not be an easy task to achieve at the moment. So, we will need to re-discuss this with our Turkish friends in the coming days. In general terms, the European Union as such is not involved in military activities in Syria and is not going to be. And, let's say, that one thing is to explore ways to guarantee humanitarian access also to the North of Syria which is something in which we are very much engaged.  As you know, we have an office in Gaziantep, on the Turkish – Syrian border, exactly bordering the area that the Turkish authorities indicate as a possible safe zone. It has been constantly working to find possible ways for safe humanitarian access to Syria, sometimes with some significant work done. I was visiting the office myself last December with Commissioner Stylianides. So, we are always in favour of finding ways of increasing humanitarian help and assistance inside Syria. It is another thing to imagine that we can create -or that someone can create -humanitarian zones free from risks and free from  Da'esh and other terrorist groups presence, in a moment when the clashes, the terrorist activities and the military activities are very much acute in that area. I would explore this option with a certain caution, but again, I have the impression that recent developments are also creating, let's say, a different environment for our Turkish friends to consider them or not - but this is not for me to elaborate on. Also, because as many Europeans might remember, we have to be careful, when defining a zone safe. We have had some sad experience, in the Balkans in particular, that we definitely do not want to repeat. At the end of the day, the real way for allowing the Syrian refugees to go back to their country safely would be to put an end to the war in Syria and to put an end to the presence of Da'esh in Syria. This is going to be the real safety of the entire zone of Syria and the real condition for them to go back. The second question was about the NATO lunch. That lunch was actually dedicated mainly to NATO adaptation. So, something completely different from our discussions today. Obviously, we also exchanged views on both Syria and Libya. I don't personally see a major role for NATO, as such, neither in Syria nor in Libya. However I know that particularly on Libya, NATO Secretary General has expressed several times his readiness to work for preparing  some sort of support if, only if and when the new Libyan government might require so. We do not have a Libyan government yet. I hope we could have one very shortly. So, it would be up to the Libyans to decide and up to NATO to work on this, it is not for me to do it. But I can tell that you that on the European Union side, we have started our planning, especially on the humanitarian, development, civilian and border management assistance support we can give to the future Libyan authorities. This includes institution building, support to deliver public services and even something on security side is very much advanced and is ready for discussion with the Libyan authorities. Because this is something I believe we have to take as an absolute starting point for us. We have shared this with the Ministers today. Whatever we might be ready to do, it will have to be discussed with the Libyan authorities [once a Government of National Accord is established]. There is not going to be any possible way for the European Union to plan something to be done on Libya alone. That is why we need to have -as a starting point - a government, taking responsibility for the country and discussing with them what kind of support they might need, in which sectors, in which forms, in which timing. It is a partnership. It is not a decision taken in Brussels and being implemented somewhere else. It is an offer that can be financially important and that we are ready to mobilise. But this is only depending on the will of the Libyan authorities and on the formation of a Government of National Unity that I sincerely hope can see the light in the coming days.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference after the Foreign Affairs Council,12.10.2015,12.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5852_en,,"Check against delivery Thank you very much. I guess that by now you have been debriefed by the Ministers coming out of the Council and also I guess that you had the chance of having a look at the Council conclusions we have adopted, on the three issues that were on our agenda today. An agenda that was focused very much on the top priorities of the international agenda. First, Migration, with a view to feed in the preparation of the European Council that is going to discuss this issue again next Thursday. We adopted Council conclusions on the external part of our action on migration, having a comprehensive view of all the things that have been done as we were tasked in previous meetings of the European Council, or in the European Agenda on migration. In the Council conclusions on migration, you find all the things that have been followed up in these months on an operational side: on the Eastern route and on the Southern route at the same time, giving  the same level of importance to both; and also taking stock of the results of the Western Balkans Conference that was held here last week as well as the preparation for the Malta Summit in November. We discussed with the Ministers today the way forward to further implementation of these decisions. On the other two points on the agenda, Libya and Syria: it reflects somehow the need we often refer to, to tackle part of the root causes of the refugee crisis and the migration crisis. Not the only ones obviously, but we know very well that conflicts and crises around us are one of the main reasons for instability that lead to this huge movement of people through Libya in the case of Mediterranean route and from Syria in the case of the Eastern route. When it comes to our discussion on Libya, Ministers often discussed this issue since I started my mandate almost one year ago. We have started a preparation, with a certain sense of anticipation, already in the beginning of the year to prepare what kind of support the European Union can provide to a Government of National Accord once it is formed. Today, the main point was, and is, to pass a strong and united message from the European Union and the Member States all together, to all the Libyan parties in these crucial hours, to invite all of them to endorse the agreement that is on their table for the sake of the Libyan people first of all, and the country. We are ready, as we have stated several times, to give all the possible support that the Libyans would require and ask for, in a spirit of partnership. We have prepared a certain number of options on different kind of support being it on basic services, municipalities, health, border control, and on the migration flow - not necessarily on the sea border, but also and mainly on the land borders, meaning the Southern border of Libya. A whole series of issues, including the counterterrorism work against Da'esh, on which the European Union, as such, is united and ready to support,  but obviously that we need to discuss with the new Libyan authorities once a government is formed in a true sense of partnership. The main message today from all the 28 Foreign Ministers and from me personally, is a plea to the Libyans, all the Libyans, to unite and give their country a chance to get out of the chaos they have been experiencing in the last years. On Syria, we had a long discussion. It was not the first one in recent times, as we dedicated our Foreign Ministers informal meeting in New York, in the margins of the General Assembly of the United Nations, to discuss this together with UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura. Somehow we have built on this informal discussion to shape our common position today.  I often hear, that on Syria in particular, Europe is divided, so I guess the news today is that ""Europe is united"" on a common stance, on our role, to trying to facilitate a political solution to the crisis on three elements. On one side, the humanitarian aspects. As you know, the European Union is the first donor and is continuing to be. We are increasing the level of our contributions, not only to cover projects inside Syria that are going on in very difficult circumstances, but also and mainly to the neighbouring countries. We are determined to increase the level of our humanitarian assistance. And we also have two other tracks, highlighted in the Council conclusions we have adopted unanimously today. On one side, the security track:  the European Union as such, and the Member States, are engaged within the global coalition against Da'esh. Not only against Da'esh, let me also mention the other terrorist organisations that are defined as terrorist organisations by the UN Security Council resolutions, and in particular al-Nusra. But the European Union itself is not involved in the military activities. We are participating in the coalition with complementary activities that contribute to the fight against Da'esh and terrorist organisations, and to the efforts to stabilise not only the situation in Syria, but also the fight against these entities in Iraq. Our main focus today was the one on the political track. Because, if there is a huge political space for EU to play a role, it is to actively, efficiently, pro-actively, support  the UN-led process. Let me be very clear on this. There are two ways of supporting a UN process. There is a neutral, easy way. No one normally argues that UN processes are not worth supporting, but there is a sort of distance. So, the UN is doing its work and we support it. We decided today to mean it. So, when we write full political weight, full diplomatic weight from the European Union to back and to support actively and efficiently the UN-led process, that means that from tonight onwards, we will work hand in hand with UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura on starting the political process leading to a transition. This is what we have discussed obviously with Staffan de Mistura in these days. We are going to engage or to reach out to different regional powers, involved in or that can have an influence in solving the conflict. I will receive tomorrow morning a visit by an Iranian delegation in Brussels, with whom we will start discussions on this. This will take place at the same time as Staffan de Mistura will be meeting Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on the same issue. We have decided to coordinate our actions very closely, and to do a little bit what the European Union has done in these recent months on Libya with the UN-led process led by Bernandino Leon: active, daily, common work, support to have the political process not only kept as an objective, but also started. Starting a process leading to a political transition is even more urgent now that the security situation is deteriorating on the ground. There is sufficient unity within the European Union to allow us to play a significant facilitating role at the side of the UN to facilitate the transition that can involve all the relevant actors inside Syria, in the region and in the broader international community. This is what we are going to do. Questions and Answers On Syria and engaging with Al-Assad When I say, and when we say in the conclusions, that it is the UN that has to lead the process - and is leading the process - we mean that it is for the UN to run some of the talks and for us to run others. We will do some of them jointly. I don't exclude that, in the near future, UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura and myself might have joint meetings with some of the actors in the region or internationally. UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, and the UN in general, are talking with the Syrian regime, and this is something that we can support in the context of our support to the UN-led process. When we talk about the need to start urgently a political process leading to a transition, it means that we have to have a reality check. We have to understand that 4,5 years after the beginning of the conflict, the situation on the ground is still the one of having Assad sitting in Damascus and terrorist organisations, in particular Da'esh, gaining ground in Syria, and also in Iraq. So, the reality check means that it is not more of the same that is going to lead to the political process to start and to end with a transition, but we need to have a different kind of approach, which means involving also representatives of the regime at the negotiating table led by the UN. On the EU mandate in Syria; and on the EU's work with Russia. On the mandate: actually the Council conclusions recall a previous mandate I received already in July. If you look at the Council conclusions we adopted at the end of July regarding the Iranian deal, there was already a reference to that precise tasking to me: ""to explore ways of building more constructive and cooperative regional dynamics."" I am going to do it. I had already started to fulfil that mandate in the last months. Obviously first with Iran. We have played a role of mediation during the nuclear talks that can give us sufficient confidence from their side to have open talks with us, also on this issue. This is going to be the first step we are going to take. Then we will also engage with the Gulf countries, starting with Saudi Arabia. I visited Riyadh already in the end of July with exactly the same purpose- to explore possibilities to build a more cooperative regional dynamic.  Having different kinds of relationships between the regional powers in the Middle East that can lead to decreased tensions and conflicts in the area is clearly in the European interest, because it is also an area that is very close geographically to us. I have had in New York, in the margins of the General Assembly, talks with both the Saudi Foreign Minister, but also with all the other GCC countries' Foreign Ministers precisely on this. We are following that up, both at my level but also at senior official's level. I would add a third element that I would explore, as a result of my mandate in the region, which is the one of Turkey. Turkey is a country that has a clear important regional dimension, a clear regional power. We tend to refer to Turkey in these days and in these weeks, mainly in relation with the refugee crisis. But what we need with Turkey is mainly a high-level foreign policy and political dialogue also on the balance in the region and on the crisis in Syria. The discussion we can have, as we have started last week, with Turkish authorities on the way forward to find a political solution on the Syrian crisis is going to be very relevant. Turkey is one of the countries with whom, as the European Union, we have intense contacts and many interests that we share. We are used to exchange intensively and very often for different reasons. Turkey is going to be  one of the key actors with which I am going to work to explore these regional possibilities. When it comes to Russia, I believe that on one side - you find it on the Council conclusions-  there is some worries on the fact that military activities might either be not targeted against Da'esh or other UN recognised terrorist organisations and on the other side not coordinated with other actors that are playing a military role in the area, which is something dangerous in itself. But on the other side, I have to underline  that very few of you, if any at all, have noticed that reference to the role that Russia can play in exercising a sort of involvement of the regime in the political process itself; that is going to be a very significant and important role that Russia can play. I believe that, in parallel to the work that the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura is doing with them, we, as the European Union, can engage directly with Russia to see if a political process can start, guaranteeing that everybody sits around the table for defining the political process that will lead to a transition. But first of all, we need to start the process. And for doing so, the role of the regional actors as well as the role of the United States and of Russia are going to be crucial. I discussed this with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York during our last bilateral meeting. I discussed it again recently with the Russian ambassador to Brussels a few days ago and we will discuss it again the next time we will meet. So, direct engagements with Russia on this, seeing the opportunity for Russia to be a relevant actor to start the political process. On Turkish calls for safe zones. And on NATO's role in Libya and the region. We have discussed the issue of safe zones first of all with our Turkish friends but also with our American partners and obviously here today with the Ministers. I have to say that my personal impression is that the developments of the last days, weeks or so, and especially the increase of military activities in precisely that part of Northern Syria, might make the plans that our Turkish friends were elaborating relatively in need for readjustment.

"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press point following the Quartet meeting at the United Nations, 30 September 2015",01.10.2015,01.10.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5906_en,,"Check against delivery We had this afternoon a meeting of the Quartet principals, following the last one we had in Munich, in February, to work together - EU, US, UN and Russia - on concrete steps on the ground in the absence of the peace process in the Middle East. We have decided to revitalize the Quartet activities. As you might know, our envoys to the Quartet have been working together very hard in these last months. They have been visiting together a number of regional key actors, in particular Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, as a way of involving them in a common effort to restart the engine of the peace process. And focus on what is probably the most viable, maybe the only viable way, today, which is focus on concrete steps on the ground, and in particular on encouraging the parties to start implementing the already signed agreements. We believe this can be a very important step in the right direction to preserve the opportunity to have two states. And start rebuilding trust and confidence, both in Israel and in Palestine, in the other party, and in the process itself. This is what we have decided; this is what we have asked our envoys to work on. This is also what I am going to discuss right now - so, sorry I will be short - with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And this is also what we shared with some of the other key actors on this file, in the second part of the meeting. You know, our Arab friends joined us to share their opinions and their views in this respect. Let me say this is going to be essential:  their full participation, and their full support to this new start, as the key interpreters of the Arab Peace Initiative that especially with a security situation we have now in the region is a main interest for all the parties involved. A regional security framework can be extremely useful and interesting for all the parties, not only of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but also in the region and worldwide. Because what we have seen today is the possibility of a dramatic inflammation of Jerusalem. The risk that if we don't act, if the leaders on the ground don't act, this can be a major source of radicalization, not only in the region, but worldwide.  So, there is urgency, and there is an international effort to encourage, to support, to invite the parties and to accompany them on this, to start from what has been already agreed. What has already been agreed can be implemented - just do it. Q: On President Abbas's statement at the General Assembly and possible impact on the work of Quartet I have listened very carefully to his words; we discussed that, two days ago. He told me about his intentions, and I have interpreted these words as a scenario that is going to happen if - and there is an 'if'. Now, on that 'if' we will have to work. That is telling us the urgency of the international and regional community to engage the Israeli leadership to have concrete steps on the ground to implement the agreements that are already there; and also the Palestinian leadership to engage in national reconciliation and in direct negotiations. And we are there to support, we are there to encourage, we are there to help if we can, because for sure it's an alarm and it’s a serious one. And I think the whole world, from East Asia to Latin America looks at this, because this has a strong symbolic power for everybody in the world. This is not something unrelated to what we were discussing this morning in the Security Council on the fight against terrorism and Da'esh. This is not something unrelated to what we are discussing when we talk about solving the political crisis or the conflicts around the world. It seems to be the 'little' crisis that has been there for decades - still maybe today, out of all the crises we have in front of us, that is the one that is possible to solve; if we have enough leadership, enough political will and enough international and regional support to push in that direction. Q: On Russia's air strike in Syria I'm here to comment on the Middle East Peace Process - help me keeping this issue on the agenda. However, I can tell you, the European Union itself is not engaged in the military side of the fight against Da'esh. Still we recognize that the military component of this fight is an important one. And as I said today in the Security Council, it is time to join forces; this is time for the international community to unite on an agenda that keeps together two sides: the security one - the fight against Da'esh that has a military component and not only - and the starting of a political process, leading to a peaceful inclusive transition for Syria. The two sides of the same coin have to go together. And I hope, I believe, there is space for the international community to join forces on both sides of this coin.

Read-out of the Commission College meeting: opening remarks by High Representative/ Vice President Federica Mogherini,23.09.2015,23.09.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5948_en,,"CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY The decision that was taken yesterday by the Interior Ministers on relocation is only one block of the building, but it is a fundamental one because it gives us the credibility to act with our partners on our external action that internal divisions were not giving before.   So, I really hope that, on the basis of this decision taken yesterday night, we – both the Commission and also the European Council this evening - can today concentrate on what positive concrete steps we can take together as Europeans all together: on the internal and on the external side of our work. The external dimension of our work on refugees and migration is probably the more fundamental element, but also the one that brings results rather in mid-to-long term period. There is no external action that turns reality upside down in one day or one week. This requires staying focused,  coherent, consistent and keeping the priorities very clear in one's mind. There is, however, one element that brings immediate results, and that is what we have been working over these past days. I will leave it to [Vice President] Kristalina [Georgieva] to reveal the details of the numbers – but restoring the funding for the agencies that operate on the ground with refugees - especially in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and in Syria itself - is going to be crucial.  These days, all of you ask: why is it so that refugees are coming to Europe now? One of the reasons is that the agencies operating on the ground have experienced funding cuts in the last months. So, it is important and we have taken the decision to contribute substantially to restoring the funds required for them to work on the ground and to improve the living conditions of the refugees in the region where they are at the moment. That is also the reason why we established the Trust Fund for Syria. Let me stress here the call, the plea, to Member States - all of them, and not only Member States, all States in the world - if they wish to, to contribute to our Trust Fund for Syria. We have an enormous amount of concrete projects that can be implemented if we have the resources, to make the life of refugees in the region, in the Middle East, more sustainable. However, we know that money, particularly when dealing with refugees and with migration, is not the magic solution to everything. These days, we are focusing our very hard work on the political track and especially on the Syrian conflict. I have met recently Staffan de Mistura, the UN Special Envoy for the conflict in Syria. We have talked again this morning on the phone. We are going to meet in New York. The European Union is putting all of its political weight to try and facilitate a solution to the conflict. And let me say that the credibility and the work we have done in reaching the Iranian deal can open some possibilities for different kind of dynamics in the region. This will be, for sure, an element of further discussion and further common action of Europeans. But let me tell you that we have already intensified immensely our work in this respect over the last weeks. One other element - and an important one - is bringing together interior and foreign angles when it comes to the Eastern route: the Western Balkan route. We will have, as you probably know, the High Level Conference on the Western Balkan route in Luxembourg on 8 October, bringing together Foreign Ministers, Interior Ministers – and not only of Member States, but also of the Balkans and of Turkey - to work together on the management of flows, on reception, and on the protection of refugees. We share a challenge and we have to find ways of managing the challenge together. As we concentrate on the refugee crisis that flows mainly from Syria through the Western Balkan route, we also have to stay focused on the Mediterranean route. Media attention shifts very quickly, but we other routes that, until few months ago were at the centre of our attention, must remain in our minds. That is why preparation for the Valletta Summit is proceeding in a very intensive manner. We have – as you know - prepared for the second phase of EUNAVFOR Med, that is to say fighting traffickers and smugglers. I will myself be visiting the Headquarters of the operation tomorrow in Rome. We will obviously also discuss this in New York next week at the General Assembly. Our Trust Fund for Africa, which is linked to facing the root causes of migration, especially in the Sahel in the Horn of Africa, is also ready for contributions, again from Member States and non-Member States. The initial contribution of the Commission is indeed quite impressive. Again, that is moreover something for Kristalina to address, but we need a global effort. We need a global coming together in order to face a crisis and a challenge that is not only European, but it is indeed a global one. Developing a concrete national plan for managing together the flows of migrants through the country before they get to Libya is something we discussed with the authorities of Niger – not only in the capital city but also in Agadez - just a few days ago. All of this preparatory work will lead to October, November, to the Malta Summit and to concrete projects we will develop on fighting smugglers' organisations before they get to Libya, and to projects offering alternative, economic opportunities to the people in Sub-Saharan Africa, so that we can also eradicate the phenomenon from there. Again, when it comes to the southern route, money is not all. Our work on pushing for a ""happy end"" to the Libyan crisis is hopefully reaching its final steps. It is the last mile of the marathon, which is always the most difficult one to run. It is now time for the Libyans to take final responsibility for the coming together of their country. We have worked with the Commission in these months to prepare a very substantial package of support of all kinds, to support a National Unity Government as soon as it is formed, from day one, or even from day zero when we have an accord. . This is something that I discussed with Bernardino Leon just yesterday night. The time has come and this would allow us to work in partnership with the Libyan authorities on management of the flows. Let me stress again: this is only one part of the strategy. It is a complex one, as you have seen, and many others are there: the work with the African Union; the work with the UNHCR; and the work with the UN. You will find it all in the Communication we have discussed today, as a follow-up, as an implementation part of the Migration Agenda we have adopted in the last months. I really hope that Heads of State and Government this evening can seriously, quietly, consistently, work on the concrete ways in which Europe can contribute to solving one of the major crises we have in these times. It is not a European crisis; it is a regional crisis; it is a global crisis. It requires a global and regional response in which Europe is called and is ready to do its part together and in partnership with others. Q:  On the idea of a peace conference on Syria. On the specific idea of a European conference on Syria, I said in my remarks that I'm working very closely and very actively with the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and the efforts that he is, together with the Security Council and the UN system, trying to put forward in these last days in particular. You might have noticed that yesterday he announced the formation of four working groups and the appointment of four coordinators for the working groups. We are actively and constantly working together with the UN on the path that is already in place, difficult as it is, as I said, with our angle –and our angle comes in particular from the strength that we have experienced in finalising the Iranian deal. I refer to that because this gives us a possible channel to work constructively with some of the key actors that have a concrete influence on some of the players of the conflict itself, in particular Iran but also Russia. We are working in that direction. A peace conference is always interesting to organise. But the key point is not having a conference, it is helping a process leading to peace. A conference can always be organised when it is very clear what the outcome of the conference would be and when it's clear what added value the conference can bring to the process. The point today is strengthening the process that the UN is trying to enforce in very difficult regional and international conditions. This is something on which I'll be working even more in the coming days in view of the General Assembly in New York, together with Member States, so that the EU's impact on this process,  that has so far been led by the United Nations - and there are reasons for that - can be even more relevant. This is the path we are following. This doesn't mean that the EU is not playing a diplomatic or political role, but in some cases it is the EU in the lead of the diplomatic process, as it was the case for the Iranian deal. In some other cases it is our common, joint political decision to invest in a process that is led by someone else, in this case the UN framework; also because there is a regional and international context that goes far beyond the European one. But with a very active, very strong and concrete support from our side. Q:  On the lack of funding of international agencies. I never said that migrants are coming now because specialised agencies have a lack of funds. I referred to refugees. I'm sorry to correct you on this, but words are important and when we have a distinction, when we analyse the background of the people who are coming to Europe's door, it is a relevant distinction. Refugees, asylum seekers need protection. We have to keep the two definitions clear in mind. There is a difference. They are two completely different situations. Indeed, the situation was known and in fact the European Union has considerably financed these agencies. Not only these agencies. Like Kristalina [Georgieva] mentioned before, the EU did not only support the UNHCR and the WFP, but also organisations that are working on the ground and that are not the big ones. I visited myself our office in Gaziantep, at the Turkish border with Syria where our people and plenty of NGOs and organisations are working thanks to our funds, also in Syria, since months. This visit took place not two weeks ago, but in December. Sometimes this doesn’t reach the wider public; sometimes it doesn't interest too much the journalists unless you have a crisis afterwards. But the support to these agencies, the support to NGOs, the support to the humanitarian efforts we are doing ourselves in these areas has been constant and very high all over time of our mandate, from the very beginning. And let me add one thing. In this refugee crisis we never mention one component of it because it doesn't reach Europe in a significant way so far, which is the Palestinian refugees situation. It is thanks to the EU funds that, in the end of August, we managed to avoid a major funding crisis of UNRWA, which is the agency dealing with the Palestinian refugees in the region, which would have led to keeping the schools closed for the Palestinian children.  Thanks to our fast and relevant action we managed to guarantee that the schools were open for the Palestinian children. There are also crisis that we prevent. They don't reach the news. But sometimes that happens also. I don't like blame games. This is not constructive. I like calls to action or calls to responsibility. Our Syria Trust Fund is established since several months now. I've said it publicly, even recently. For the moment it is aimed at dealing with the refugees from Syria in the region and in Syria. So far it is supported by the European Union funds and by two Member States. All the others and all partners in the world that want to contribute, that call for major investments on the ground, are very kindly invited to do so. Q:  Sur la situation au Liban Je viens de dire, pendant notre réunion du Collège, que notre attention et notre travail avec le Liban est extrêmement important. Pas seulement parce que le Liban accueille un nombre important de réfugiés, si je ne me trompe pas , autour de 25% de sa population totale; mais parce que c'est un défi pour le système du pays, pour les communautés locales, pour le système d'éducation, pour le système de santé, pour le système économique et social. La stratégie pour le Liban est premièrement de travailler avec les autorités du pays. Je vais rencontrer le Premier Ministre la semaine prochaine à New York. J'ai rencontré le ministre des affaires étrangères il y a je pense, une semaine ou une dizaine de jours à Paris, en marge d'une conférence internationale sur la protection des minorités au Moyen-Orient. Premièrement, la stratégie sera de travailler ensemble. Parce que c'est seulement avec une connaissance profonde de la réalité locale, que l'on peut avoir les réponses pour agir de façon ciblée. Deuxièmement, un soutien financier important. Quand je parle de soutien financier, je parle de l' appui aux pays de la région Liban, Turquie, Jordanie et Irak, qui accueillent la majorité des réfugiés syriens en ce moment. Troisièmement, un soutien politique mais aussi un soutien sécuritaire. On fait un travail énorme pour essayer de soutenir, par exemple, un processus qui peut amener à l'élection d'un président dans le pays, parce que la force des institutions au Liban fait aussi partie de la force du pays: un pays délicat avec un équilibre délicat. Nous soutenons les forces de sécurité du pays qui sont elles-mêmes un des éléments de l'unité d'un pays qui connaissent des différences internes très importantes. J'ai dit ce matin au Collège qu'il est très important de considérer le Liban, qui est un pays fragile du fait de la composition du pays, son histoire et qui est en train d'accueillir un nombre énorme de réfugiés par rapport à sa population, comme une priorité. Notre stratégie est la suivante : dialogue et partenariat politique avec les autorités du pays pour identifier les lignes d'action les plus efficaces; soutien financier à l'accueil, et pas seulement les camps, mais aussi les communautés locales qui accueillent les camps. Je connais bien la situation, j'ai été en visite plusieurs fois dans tout le pays. Enfin, un travail sur le renforcement de la situation institutionnelle et de sécurité du pays, pour faire en sorte que la résilience soit renforcée. La stabilité des pays auxquels nous faisons référence en tant que pays d'accueil des réfugiés est elle-même une partie très importante de la stabilité de la région. Si le Liban, si la Turquie, si la Jordanie, si l'Irak font face à une instabilité majeure, ce sera un problème en plus pour la région, qui sera impossible à gérer. Alors il faut investir dans la stabilité du pays et dans la force de ses institutions. Bruxelles"
"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the informal meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers, Gymnich",05.09.2015,05.09.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6042_en,,"We obviously focused today, in a meeting that was not an easy one, on the refugee crisis. And here we need to start using the right words: it is partially a migrant flow, but it is mainly a refugee flow, which puts us in a different situation when it comes to our legal and moral duties. In our eyes we have the pictures of the people marching from Budapest to Vienna, with European flags. And let me start by saying that I was in contact this morning with Chancellor Faymann to thank him for what he has been arranging at the border and to show him all the support and solidarity. It is becoming every day clearer to all of us that this is not something that is affecting or is going to affect one or another Member State, but all of us. A few months ago, it was an issue only Italy, or Malta, Spain or Greece were raising; today, it's mainly focused on, when you talk of Member States, Hungary, Greece, Austria and Germany. It could turn to other Member States in the future. And I hope – finally, finally – we all realise that these people are coming to Europe, not to one or another Member State. They are coming to Europe. Unfortunately, it took us some months to realise this, but maybe that awareness is finally there. Let me say that I believe it was very important to discuss this issue today with the Candidate Countries – that, by the way, sit on the Western Balkan route – because this is an issue concerning not only all the European Union Member States, but also Europe as a whole, as a continent. It is a regional crisis: it's not only a European crisis, it is a regional crisis. And a global crisis, too: that is why we discussed it, and I discuss it on a daily basis with the UN and UN system, starting with UNHCR. Talking about this with the Candidate Countries – who are on our same boat in dealing with this crisis, with these flows – reminded us that we have to strengthen even more our cooperation and work together without any kind of blame game among us. Among us, Europeans – Member States, Candidate Countries, institutions. We are all facing a dramatic, a dramatic event. I don't say an emergency event, because this is not an emergency: it is an urgency we are facing, but it is not something that starts one day and finishes another day. It is here to stay and the sooner we accept it, politically and psychologically, the sooner we will be able to respond in an effective way and manage it in an effective way. So the time for blame games is over. It is time for taking decisions, turning decisions into actions and doing it united, as Europeans. Only in this way we will have the possibility to face this issue, this urgency, this dramatic event, being faithful to our European values – the values of respect of human rights and solidarity. It was important to discuss it with candidate countries also because for historical reasons, when it comes to the Balkans, and for geographical reasons, when it comes to Turkey - they know very well what we are talking about. And I think, in these dramatic days and weeks, we Europeans have to keep in mind the history of our continent. We know what war, conflict are, and facing a situation that forces you to flee. And as Jean [Asselborn, Foreign Minister of Luxembourg] mentioned, we are talking here of a flow of people that in these weeks - can change - mainly consists of Syrians, Afghans, Eritreans and Iraqis. So we are currently not talking about a migration, an economic migration flow. We are mostly talking about refugees, to whom we have a moral and a legal duty. Now we agreed to strengthen our cooperation – not only within the European Union, but also with the Candidate Countries – on five different levels, with very concrete actions. Some of them have started already, some of them are going to be further defined in the coming days and weeks – and in particular with the package that the Commission is going to adopt in this coming week, with the decisions that the Ministers of Interior and Justice will be called to take within one week, ten days from now. Then our next steps as Foreign Ministers: we will have a Foreign Affairs Council, a European Council, which for the moment are planned for October, but obviously we stand ready to have emergency meetings at any time. We were the ones… I was the one suggesting and proposing, at the beginning of the perception of this acute crisis in March, to hold a joint meeting right here in Luxembourg. Today, we took our discussions and decisions as Foreign Ministers. We might meet again with Interior Ministers. It is important that we take into consideration the fact that the external side of our action makes it possible to look for solutions, real ones, to this refugee crisis, but the internal decisions, the internal policies that the European Union puts in place – or doesn't put in place – reinforce or weaken our credibility also in the external action. So the link is there on many different levels. So, we agreed to strengthen cooperation on five different elements. First of all, how to ensure better protection to those in need of protection: asylum seekers are entitled to the status of refugee. Second, manage borders in full respect of our values, first of all respect for human rights. Third, fighting against smugglers' and traffickers' networks. This is something, as you know, we have been working a lot on. When it comes to the Mediterranean route, we launched an operation in the Mediterranean to fight the traffickers, smugglers at sea. And as I did with the Defence Ministers the day before yesterday, today I shared again with the Foreign Ministers my suggestion to transit to phase 2 of this operation, which would allow us to operate in high seas to fight the traffickers and smugglers. And I have found a large consensus about that need for the naval operation. Obviously, we will also need to increase the level of our actions against the traffickers organisations on the mainland, when it comes to the Western Balkans route. Fourth, strengthening our partnership with third countries, mainly countries of origin and transit. Here, obviously, we are working on readmission and return agreements, but not only. We know very well that it is very important for our partners, especially in Africa and the Middle East, to work together with us on economic developments, opportunities for growth and jobs, especially for their young people. I started to work in this direction in very concrete ways when I met the Foreign Ministers of the Sahel G5 countries, and I am planning a visit to Niger very soon, in the coming weeks, to continue working with them. As you know, Niger is one of the main transit countries on the Mediterranean route. And we have also shared with the ministers the proposal to establish a trust fund for Africa. Fifth point, that is maybe the most important, even if it is the most long term plan - it is our common work on what we call the root causes. In this case, that has mainly two aims. One is Libya, when it comes to the Southern corridor. And here, we have re-expressed all our active support to the last phases… hopefully, the last phases of the UN-led negotiations to form a National Unity Government in Libya. Let’s re-stress this again: the European Union, its Member States – I would say the whole international community, but here we can only speak for ourselves – are ready to support in all possible ways, from day one, a new government of national unity in Libya, to manage all the difficult challenges it will have in front of itself. And [the other is] Syria: this is why the other issues we had on the agenda today and yesterday are not less relevant than this one, because we have to connect the dots. When we talk about the follow-up to the Iranian deal, or about the Middle East Peace Process, when we talk about the medium and long run – this is not detached from the difficult issue we have been discussing today, the refugee crisis. The reason why we are facing this major crisis now – [a crisis] that has different features than the ones we have seen in the past years – is exactly because the conflicts around us have multiplied. In particular, when it comes to the conflict in Syria, we have to intensify our work, and we are ready to do it as European Union, to find a political solution to the conflict. Hopefully the deal we had with Iran on their nuclear programme in July could also open the way for a different kind of regional framework that could facilitate steps for reaching a solution to the Syrian conflict. Let me spend a few words on the other two points we had on the agenda. One in the Middle East, and not far away from the issue of migration – because we have started to see Palestinians in the flow of refugees and we know very well that there is a huge Palestinian refugee problem in the region. On the Middle East, we had a very long and substantial discussion with the ministers yesterday to prepare our next steps. Yesterday, I shared with those of you that were here already that we have worked together with our partners in the Quartet, namely with the UN, with the US – I was speaking with John Kerry yesterday – and with Russia, to prepare a new start of the Quartet. We will have a Quartet principals/foreign ministers meeting – together with Ban Ki Moon - at the margins of the UN General Assembly later this month where we have invited the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States. This is not irrelevant, because we have to build partnerships and a common work in the region, and our region is also the Mediterranean and the Middle East. To make sure that the Middle East Peace Process’s engine could be restarted, after more than one year of stalling, is also one way for us to contribute to a better understanding and a better sense of cooperation between Europe and the Arab World, the whole Middle East. It is not only a matter of justice, a matter of need for peace and stability and security. The Middle East conflict, when it comes to Israel and Palestine, is decades long. But there is one additional element, recently, which is the presence of Daesh in the region. We should not underestimate it. It is also our common interest to tackle the issue of MEPP, even if it is not the top issue on the agenda, or a media issue so much now. It is very important and I am confident we can prepare some steps in the coming weeks to restart the engine of the process. Last but not least: yesterday we had a good discussion on our relations with Russia. When it comes to the issue of migration and refugees, when it comes to the issue of the Middle East Peace Process, when it comes to the issue of the Iranian deal, [our relation with Russia] is a constructive one. But in this framework, we should not forget that our Eastern neighbours are facing very difficult conditions when it comes to their relations with Russia. First of all, on Ukraine we have restated our strong commitment to support the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. The EU contribution to that is the facilitation of the trilateral talks, especially on energy and gas and on the implementation of the DCFTA. We also discussed our relations with our other Eastern partners, especially focusing on the developments in Belarus – they are obviously very encouraging, with the release of prisoners we witnessed on 22 August. Also developments in Georgia, Moldova, and attention to Azerbaijan and Armenia - after the Riga summit we need to strengthen our work and relationship with our partners to the East. The fact we are facing major issues to our South and South-East, the refugee crisis and many conflicts, should not make us forget that our Eastern partners need our support. We continue to work very closely with them, on a daily basis. Thank you! Luxembourg"

This is also related to the stability, security and peace in the Middle East. We should not forget crises when they are out of your own attention and keep our work going also on the files that are open since decades, as in this case. I can share with you today already that we have made some progress - the European Union has revitalised the work of the Quartet in these months. Just in these hours UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sent invitation letters to the Foreign Ministers of the Quartet to convene a meeting of the Quartet principles in New York, in a few weeks from now, at the margins of the General Assembly of the United Nations. And also on the initiative of the European Union, he has extended similar invitations to join to the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia and to the Secretary General of the Arab League. We hope that this re-start of the process can lead to improvements on the ground and also to re-open prospective and political horizons to the talks. Staying in the Middle East, we will also have on the agenda something positive, because crises sometimes find a happy end. It is not there yet, but we are getting there. We will discuss the follow-up of the Iranian deal and also its regional implications. This is very much related also to the migration crisis, because we know very well that the roots of many of the refugees and the refugee crises that we are facing today in Europe - and not only in Europe also in the Middle East itself - are rooted in the crises and conflicts we have in Syria and in the Middle East at large. So we will start discussing that; obviously this issue, especially the Syrian crisis, will come back to the Foreign Ministers in a formal setting in one of the next Foreign Affairs Council, but we will start discussing the follow up of the Iranian deal with the Ministers. Migration and refugee crisis for sure will be the heart of our work in these two days as it was the case also with the Defence Ministers yesterday, when we discussed the transition to Phase two of our operation in the Mediterranean against the traffickers and the smugglers. With the Foreign Ministers I expect we will focus mainly on our work with third countries: countries of origin and transit. I will visit myself Niger very soon, within the month before the UN General Assembly. We will complement in this way the work of the Defence Ministers and the work that the Interior Ministers will have to do, because large part of our policy on our response to the refugee crisis has to have a coherent approach also in our internal policies as the European Union. Obviously this is something I am dealing with as Vice-President of the Commission, but I don't expect Foreign Ministers to focus too much on that, even if they are politicians and part of governments, so that is a discussion that might come up. That is for tomorrow morning so you will hear more on that tomorrow probably at the press conference. Last but not least, let me say this: I have been repeating for months that while we were focusing on our Eastern Neighbourhood when we had the most heated times of the Ukrainian crisis, I was repeating time and again that we should not forget what was happening in Libya, Syria and the Middle East. Today I can say: we should not forget what is happening in the East and in our Eastern Neighbourhood. That is why we will have a free and forward-looking discussion on our relations with Russia, our relations and our support to our friends in the East, starting obviously from Ukraine, but also to Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. So it is going to be a full agenda, very busy one, very substantial one, as you see and I expect, as it is the case always when we have discussions with Foreign Ministers and even more when we have informal discussions, very open, very productive and very substantial one. Thank you! Watch the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I108271 Luxembourg"

High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini meeting with Ukrainian President Poroshenko,27.08.2015,27.08.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6061_en,,"High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission Federica Mogherini met with the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko as part of the President's visit to Brussels on 27 August 2015. President Poroshenko, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, provided an update on the security situation in eastern Ukraine, where the recent escalation of fighting was of particular concern, as well as harassment of the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission by separatists. High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini underlined the European Union's continued support for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, starting with respect for the ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. The EU would continue its support notably for the OSCE, the facilitation of ongoing trilateral discussions with Ukraine and Russia on energy security and continuing trilateral talks on the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement's provisions on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. The High Representative welcomed President Poroshenko's update regarding the country's progress on constitutional reform enabling decentralisation, as well the announcement of an agreement reached between Ukraine and its ad-hoc creditor committee on debt, which should allow for the continued vigorous pursuit of economic and political reforms. Both the President and the High Representative hoped for further rapid progress on the path to visa-free travel between Ukraine and the EU. High Representative Mogherini reiterated her position for the release of Nadiya Savchenko, Oleg Sentsov, Oleksandr Kolchenko and other Ukrainian prisoners in the Russian Federation and their safe return to Ukraine. The High Representative accepted the President's invitation to visit again Ukraine in the near future. For more information: http://www.eeas.europa.eu/ukraine/ Bruxelles"

"Remarks by EU HR/VP Federica Mogherini at joint press conference with Marina Kaljurand, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Tallin",24.08.2015,24.08.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3183_en,," CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY Thank you very much Marina. It is a pleasure for me being here and an honour being invited to address the conference of the Ambassadors - some of them I have had the chance and honour again to meet during my visits where they are posted. And it is moreover for me and again a pleasure to be visiting Estonia and I apologise for not coming before. But it's really great to be here today on this occasion that I have in visiting all the Capital cities of the 28 Member States, to discuss together – with different interlocutors in the governments, and not only – the Common European Foreign and Security Policy. We are 28 different, very different Member States. Different for geography, history, politics but very much united when it comes to our common values, our common interests. And at no other time like today, we realise how importartant it is to stick together and to make sure that our union is true and truly united Europe, a true Union. When we are united, when we act united, we are stronger and we have the possibility to achieve the goals we want to reach; being it on security and defence – and defence today goes much broader than purely military –and, as here you know very well, including cyber security; being it relations with our partners in our neighbourhood, East and South; being it on big global issues we face together in the UN, with NATO, with our main partners around the world, starting with the United States. On the difficult global issues we need to face starting from migration as we discussed at length but also other issues. We have had our first proper bilateral after you took office Marina, it's really a pleasure working with you and it has been a pleasure having you at the Foreign Affairs Council, your first Foreign Affairs Council in July. I am looking forward to continue working with you very closely, coordinating very closely in these coming months. And let me add that, to me, this was also an occasion to exchange views with the Minister, with the Ambassadors and with the interlocutors I will have the privilege to meet later today, especially on the security situation of the region, the situation in Ukraine, in the other countries of the Eastern Partnership and on our relations with Russia. Let me stress all our solidarity and our closeness with the Estonian people, to the Estonian authorities, for the police officer that is detained in Russia. We discussed that over the phone last week, and I had the chance of releasing a statement immediately after we knew the decision taken by the Court. We will continue to follow the case closely and to work together. Not only on this respect but also on other issues that are of common concern. Our unity means that we are united in our common positions and that we shape our policies together and that we show solidarity on all issues that are important in our Member States, no matter how big or small, or new or old, or North or South or East or West, we are one and it is for me always a pleasure and a privilege to be able to work so closely with a Foreign Minister of a Member State - and with Marina it is also a personal pleasure. Thank you very much. Q & A Q: On the situation regarding Eston Kohver As you know very well, we cannot, as European Union, obviously take concrete measures to have him back. You would not expect that to happen probably, but still, we discussed concrete steps and measures that European Union is taking to support the Estonian authorities in their work. Our main task is to support the Member States in these difficult circumstances. I understand that these are crucial days, the ones that come, and we obviously will continue to closely, very closely coordinate our actions, our statements and our steps together with the Estonian authorities and in coordination with the family of the Officer obviously as well. It is not for the European Union to step in but to support and to back the Estonian authorities' activities, steps and initiatives as much as it can be useful for the Estonian authorities and for the Officer himself. Q: On EU action towardsnon-EU countries dealing with the migrant crisis Normally, I tend to avoid answering questions that do not relate closely to the issues we discussed. What we discussed related to migration with Marina – with the Minister – is first of all the aspects that are linked to our work, which is the external one. Our work to help, facilitate, try to reach a solution to the crises and the conflicts that are open around us. As we know,these flows of refugees are coming mainly from crises areas, starting from Syria, but also Afghanistan and others, and this relates very much to our work with the Foreign Ministers and in my capacity as High Representative. And obviously, the work we do with the countries of origin and transit to manage the flows together with them. In this case, I will do an exception, because in my capacity as the Vice-President of the Commission I also share the responsibility of the presentation of the Agenda on Migration that the Commission presented last spring and the work we have done with the Council also in this respect. And I would say that we are working very closely with the countries of the Western Balkans to tackle this issue, that again, as I mentioned, is less related to Foreign Policy and more to the relations with the region and to the European Union as such. And, as you might know, we are planning to have soon a conference dealing especially with this aspect of the flows that are passing through the Balkans. This refers more to aspects that are linked to internal policies of the Union rather than to the Foreign policy of the European Union, if not on the aspects linked to the crises that generate the flows of refugees. That is why I am coordinating, I am working with my colleagues in the Commission that are mainly responsible for this,who are Vice-President Timmermans and Commissioner Avramopoulos, and obviously the Enlargement Commissioner Hahn. Q: On contacts with Mr Lavrov I met Minister Lavrov quite recently actually, while we were negotiating the Iranian deal we were spending quite some time together. I also met him in Kuala Lumpur in Asia on the 7 August for the Asia Regional Forum and I guess I will meet him again in New York in the UN General Assembly, as I think will be the case for many of us. This is one of the issues that we constantly raise, not only me personally, but also through our delegation in Moscow. The Russians know very well where we stand on this case and what our position is, and as I said, we coordinate in a very positive way our public messages and our steps together with the Minister all along the way. So, yes, sure we raise it, not only publicly, but also when we meet. Q: On Turkey and migration issue You should ask the Turkish Foreign Minister probably. You used a word that we often use without realising that actually it hides a different kind of story. You said the migrants or refugees come from Turkey, as well as we normally say when it is the case of refugees coming to for instance Italy or Malta, fromLibya. These refugees comethrough Libya or throughTurkey, but their origin is in a different place. That is why we are increasing our level of cooperation with Turkey to manage the flow. Turkey itself has a huge issue of welcoming and hosting refugees from Syria that I think is close to 2 million people. I myself visited the refugee camp in Gaziantep at the border between Turkey and Syria some months ago, and I think that in this story of this huge migration flow and refugees flow that we are experiencing due to the large number of crises we have around us, we have to realise that the blame game is not bringing any kind of positive result for any of us. The main point is not saying who is doing his homework or not. The point is how do we face together the challenge and how do we manage together the issue. Again, from a European perspective we are asking Turkey to do more. Turkey itself is hosting millions of refugees, we should be aware of that, and we are already supporting Turkey in this. But again, what we should do more is to work together also with Turkey, but also with other countries, not only to support them in hosting this large number of refugees, but also to help in the management of the flow and most of all, to try to solve the root causes, which is in this case the Syrian conflict, but also the destabilisation of Afghanistan, when it comes to the route that goes through Turkey to Greece, or when it comes to the route that is going through Libya to Malta and Italy, to stabilise the situation in the Sahel in the Horn of Africa, in the Western part of Africa, and first and foremost, to try to find - finally- a government of National Unity in Libya that can allow us to work together with the Libyan authorities to fight the smugglers and the traffickers of human beings and to put an end to the trafficking. Q: On the release of Estonian and British ship guards detained in India? This is an issue we discussed with the Minister; this is an issue we discussed in the European Parliament some months ago, in the presence of Estonian Members of Parliament, but also others from all the different political groups. What I can say – obviously in full respect of the Indian judicial system - is that the EU is always ready and willing to support its Member States in the steps and in the decisions that they take when it comes to this kind of cases. This is also the case when it comes to this case. I assured the Minister that she can count on my personal commitment, to not only follow closely the situation, but also give all the needed support and will. All the support that is not only needed but also required and desired from the Estonian authorities to find – hopefully - a quick solution and respectful of the situation of the people involved, that I understand on the humanitarian basis could be considered.

"Remarks by EU HR/VP Federica Mogherini at joint press conference with Marina Kaljurand, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Tallin",24.08.2015,24.08.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6068_en,,"CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY Thank you very much Marina. It is a pleasure for me being here and an honour being invited to address the conference of the Ambassadors - some of them I have had the chance and honour again to meet during my visits where they are posted. And it is moreover for me and again a pleasure to be visiting Estonia and I apologise for not coming before. But it's really great to be here today on this occasion that I have in visiting all the Capital cities of the 28 Member States, to discuss together – with different interlocutors in the governments, and not only – the Common European Foreign and Security Policy. We are 28 different, very different Member States. Different for geography, history, politics but very much united when it comes to our common values, our common interests. And at no other time like today, we realise how importartant it is to stick together and to make sure that our union is true and truly united Europe, a true Union. When we are united, when we act united, we are stronger and we have the possibility to achieve the goals we want to reach; being it on security and defence – and defence today goes much broader than purely military –and, as here you know very well, including cyber security; being it relations with our partners in our neighbourhood, East and South; being it on big global issues we face together in the UN, with NATO, with our main partners around the world, starting with the United States. On the difficult global issues we need to face starting from migration as we discussed at length but also other issues. We have had our first proper bilateral after you took office Marina, it's really a pleasure working with you and it has been a pleasure having you at the Foreign Affairs Council, your first Foreign Affairs Council in July. I am looking forward to continue working with you very closely, coordinating very closely in these coming months. And let me add that, to me, this was also an occasion to exchange views with the Minister, with the Ambassadors and with the interlocutors I will have the privilege to meet later today, especially on the security situation of the region, the situation in Ukraine, in the other countries of the Eastern Partnership and on our relations with Russia. Let me stress all our solidarity and our closeness with the Estonian people, to the Estonian authorities, for the police officer that is detained in Russia. We discussed that over the phone last week, and I had the chance of releasing a statement immediately after we knew the decision taken by the Court. We will continue to follow the case closely and to work together. Not only on this respect but also on other issues that are of common concern. Our unity means that we are united in our common positions and that we shape our policies together and that we show solidarity on all issues that are important in our Member States, no matter how big or small, or new or old, or North or South or East or West, we are one and it is for me always a pleasure and a privilege to be able to work so closely with a Foreign Minister of a Member State - and with Marina it is also a personal pleasure. Thank you very much. Q & A Q: On the situation regarding Eston Kohver As you know very well, we cannot, as European Union, obviously take concrete measures to have him back. You would not expect that to happen probably, but still, we discussed concrete steps and measures that European Union is taking to support the Estonian authorities in their work. Our main task is to support the Member States in these difficult circumstances. I understand that these are crucial days, the ones that come, and we obviously will continue to closely, very closely coordinate our actions, our statements and our steps together with the Estonian authorities and in coordination with the family of the Officer obviously as well. It is not for the European Union to step in but to support and to back the Estonian authorities' activities, steps and initiatives as much as it can be useful for the Estonian authorities and for the Officer himself. Q: On EU action towardsnon-EU countries dealing with the migrant crisis Normally, I tend to avoid answering questions that do not relate closely to the issues we discussed. What we discussed related to migration with Marina – with the Minister – is first of all the aspects that are linked to our work, which is the external one. Our work to help, facilitate, try to reach a solution to the crises and the conflicts that are open around us. As we know,these flows of refugees are coming mainly from crises areas, starting from Syria, but also Afghanistan and others, and this relates very much to our work with the Foreign Ministers and in my capacity as High Representative. And obviously, the work we do with the countries of origin and transit to manage the flows together with them. In this case, I will do an exception, because in my capacity as the Vice-President of the Commission I also share the responsibility of the presentation of the Agenda on Migration that the Commission presented last spring and the work we have done with the Council also in this respect. And I would say that we are working very closely with the countries of the Western Balkans to tackle this issue, that again, as I mentioned, is less related to Foreign Policy and more to the relations with the region and to the European Union as such. And, as you might know, we are planning to have soon a conference dealing especially with this aspect of the flows that are passing through the Balkans. This refers more to aspects that are linked to internal policies of the Union rather than to the Foreign policy of the European Union, if not on the aspects linked to the crises that generate the flows of refugees. That is why I am coordinating, I am working with my colleagues in the Commission that are mainly responsible for this,who are Vice-President Timmermans and Commissioner Avramopoulos, and obviously the Enlargement Commissioner Hahn. Q: On contacts with Mr Lavrov I met Minister Lavrov quite recently actually, while we were negotiating the Iranian deal we were spending quite some time together. I also met him in Kuala Lumpur in Asia on the 7 August for the Asia Regional Forum and I guess I will meet him again in New York in the UN General Assembly, as I think will be the case for many of us. This is one of the issues that we constantly raise, not only me personally, but also through our delegation in Moscow. The Russians know very well where we stand on this case and what our position is, and as I said, we coordinate in a very positive way our public messages and our steps together with the Minister all along the way. So, yes, sure we raise it, not only publicly, but also when we meet. Q: On Turkey and migration issue You should ask the Turkish Foreign Minister probably. You used a word that we often use without realising that actually it hides a different kind of story. You said the migrants or refugees come from Turkey, as well as we normally say when it is the case of refugees coming to for instance Italy or Malta, fromLibya.

Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini on the verdict against Estonian police officer Kohver,19.08.2015,19.08.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3189_en,," Today, almost one year after the abduction of Estonian police officer Eston Kohver by the Russian Security Services on Estonian territory, the Pskov Oblast's regional court rendered a verdict against him. The conviction carries a sentence of 15 years imprisonment. Mr Kohver’s abduction and subsequent illegal detention in Russia constitute a clear violation of international law. Moreover, from the very beginning, Mr Kohver has been deprived of the right to a fair trial: there was no public hearing of the case, the Estonian consul was not allowed to be present at the hearings and Mr Kohver was deprived of adequate legal aid. Despite repeated requests, the Russian authorities have failed to resolve the issue. The EU continues to call on the Russian Federation to act according to its international obligations, release Mr Kohver immediately and guarantee his safe return to Estonia. Bruxelles"
"Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following her meeting with Adel bin Ahmed AL-JUBEIR, Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs",27.07.2015,27.07.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6083_en,,"Riyadh - 27 July 2015 Check against delivery. Thank you very much first of all for the invitation, and secondly but very importantly for hosting me here in Riyadh at a special time of the year. I am very grateful for this and I am sure that this is going to be the beginning of a very strong - also personal - cooperation. I would like to congratulate you for your beginning in office in very difficult times, but with very good results already. I would also like to thank you for the warm welcome as well as the excellent and long exchange of views on all the main important issues we have in common between the European Union and Saudi Arabia, starting by the important bilateral relations that cover all fields of our public life, from the talks we had on visa issues, to security and counter-terrorism cooperation, energy and trade economic opportunities, people to people contacts. We have deep relations and we - on the European side - are willing to strengthen them even more. We have also discussed the possibility of structuring our cooperation even more, on a bilateral level or through the GCC-EU cooperation, and the use of the idea we discussed at the last meeting of the EU-GCC Ministerial a couple of months ago of tackling issues of human rights through a separate working group in the Gulf Cooperation Council. I have particularly appreciated our common visions on the Middle East Peace Process, where we in the European Union believe that the Saudi Arabia has a key role to play, in particular in reviving the Arab Peace Initiative that could be an important element of the way forward to restart the process that at the moment is not in place. We are very much aware in the European Union that the lack of process in itself is creating a vacuum that is extremely dangerous, in Gaza, in Jerusalem and in the West Bank. We have discussed the ways of cooperating together with other friends and partners in the region and in the international scene, such as the United States, the UN, Russia, other key Arab countries, to recreate the conditions for a Middle East Peace Process to bring concrete results on the ground and the creation of the Palestinian State on one side and on the other the right of Israel to live in security. We have also shared common approach on the need to put an end to the too long-lasting war in Syria, with enormous dramatic humanitarian consequences and also security consequences for the entire region. When I say region I say the Gulf region but also the European region, because we share a part of the world that today is the most dangerous one in the world. And our common work to find finally the way for Syrian-led transition in Syria and effective fight against Da’esh I think is the top priority on both of our agendas As it is, as the Minister very rightly said, it's time to support the Iraqi reform agenda in a very concrete and operational way to make sure that the Sunni community - not only in Iraq, but also actually in all the Arab countries - is empowered so it can lead the fight against Da’esh, with a leading role and with full powers. We have discussed Yemen, with the dramatic humanitarian situation and the need to find a political solution there and the situation in Libya where, hopefully, the first partial agreement that was reached a few days ago in Morocco, could be opened up to the support also from the one party out of the four that didn't support it so far, so that Libya can start a new path. We have been working in the European Union to make sure that if and when Libya will face this new beginning, it will get all the European support on its way to stabitilisation and prosperity. We have dedicated also significant part of our talks to the deal that we have reached with Iran in Vienna on the 14 July, that I have facilitated on behalf of the international community. That was a mandate originated by a UN Security Council resolution. Long negotiations. Twelve years, at the end 22 months, and many months and weeks and nights and days of hard work. And if that took so much time and so much hard work, that was exactly because we are all very much aware that we needed to have a strong solid agreement, leaving nothing to further interpretation or discussion but very detailed and ready for implementation. As you know, tomorrow, I will be visiting Tehran, exactly to start work on the implementation of the agreement, as I will be - in my capacity as a High Representative of the European Union - coordinating the work of the joint commission that will supervise the implementation of the agreement. So it is very important for me, personally, first to pass a message that the agreement is strong and solid. It's first of all a nuclear non-proliferation agreement that will guarantee that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon for the next ten to fifteen years and with solid mechanisms of snapback of sanctions. Having said that, we are very much aware of the concerns, of the worries of the countries of the region, also in Europe. We are quite close to the region as well, so we understand the concerns very well. And it is important for us to make sure that the agreement is not only a solid and robust one as it was and as it is, but also that it is implemented in full. And we will do all that we can to make sure that this happens. Obviously, this is not only an issue of non-proliferation and nuclear weapons, this is also a regional issue and my message to Tehran - and we discussed this with the Minister at length - will also be that of taking the opportunity to shape a different regional framework. Passing from confrontation to cooperation could lead the way to solving, starting to solve many of the regional crises we are facing in this part of the world. And we, as Europeans, will invest all our political capital to try and facilitate the change of paradigm to pass from confrontation to cooperation in this region. I would like very much to thank you, Minister, for your excellent work and the excellent conversation we've had and the fantastic cooperation I'm sure we'll have with Saudi Arabia and Europe in the coming months.

EU-Ukraine hold Human Rights Dialogue,25.07.2015,25.07.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6091_en,,"The European Union and Ukraine held their annual Human Rights Dialogue meeting on 24 July in Kyiv. The EU delegation was led by Mr Dirk Schuebel, Head of Division for bilateral relations with the Eastern Partnership countries in the European External Action Service. The Ukrainian delegation was led by Mr. Anton Yanchuk, Deputy Minister of Justice of Ukraine. The EU-Ukraine Human Rights Dialogue convened in its second meeting since the signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in which the EU and Ukraine express mutual commitment to common values, in particular full respect for democratic principles, rule of law, good governance, human rights and fundamental freedoms. In line with its policy of consulting civil society ahead of its meetings on human rights, the EU met with representatives of Ukrainian and international NGOs prior to the dialogue. The meeting was held in an open and constructive atmosphere, allowing for a thorough exchange of views on the human rights situation in Ukraine and on the country's commitment to achieving sustainable progress in this area. Following up on developments since the last meeting in July 2014, discussions covered a range of issues of mutual interest, from the deteriorating human rights situation in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula and non-government controlledareas in eastern Ukraine to ensuring accountability, reform of the electoral framework and freedom of media and peaceful assembly in the country. The exchanges also included non-discrimination policy, including rights of LGBTI persons and persons belonging to ethnic, linguistic, religious and national minorities, the rights of the child as well as gender equality and women's rights. The EU used the opportunity to present its new Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for the period 2015-2019, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 July. The EU re-emphasised the importance it attaches to Ukraine's ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and stressed the need to investigate and ensure accountability for all reported human rights violations, including allegations of possible war crimes, committed in the context of the ongoing armed conflict, and to ensure full compliance with International Humanitarian Law by all sides. In addition, Ukraine and the EU discussed the on-going judicial proceedings in Russia against Ukrainian citizens Nadiya Savchenko, Oleh Sentsov and Oleksandr Kolchenko, which are being closely monitored by the EU. The meeting was preceded by the Subcommittee on Justice, Freedom and Security on 23 July in Kyiv that covered policy areas such as reform of the judiciary and law enforcement, fight against corruption, asylum and migration policy, border security and data protection. The next Human Rights Dialogue meeting between Ukraine and the EU is scheduled to take place in summer 2016. Kyiv"

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the Foreign Affairs Council,22.06.2015,22.06.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6342_en,,"Luxembourg Check against delivery As you know today we had an important set of Conclusions adopted in the beginning. Among them was the launch of the naval operation against the traffickers in the Mediterranean Sea. I already had the opportunity to brief you , I might maybe add the list of countries contributing to the operation as I understand it was not communicated to you, so we will add this information that is: Italy, the UK, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, France, Luxembourg, Spain, Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden. So if you see the composition, the long list and the variety of regions of Europe represented you will understand it is really a European Union operation regardless of South, North, East or West. This means that we are united in this as well as we have been united in one of the other Council Conclusions we have adopted this morning such as was the rollover of the sanctions on Russia related to the situation in the East of Ukraine. We had other important topics today in the Council. First of all we had the first ever discussion on energy diplomacy together with Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič. We know and we see very well that more and more energy and foreign policy are closely linked. So we had the first discussion with the Foreign Ministers on how to better support European Union diplomacy action with foreign policy instruments, in order to support our energy interests and the energy Union. We will come back to this issue  quite regularly with the Foreign Affairs Council. We have had then a discussion on some elements of our relations with Asia. We have discussed in particular our relations with China in view of the next EU-China summit next week, as well as the relations between the European Union and ASEAN and our projects that can be developed together with some Asian partners on connectivity. We had an important meeting with the Secretary General of the United Nations  Ban Ki-moon. After he visited Brussels last month for meetings with the development ministers and with the College of Commissioners, he had – for the first time I understand of his mandate – the opportunity to meet all the 28 Foreign Ministers in this format We exchanged with him in particular in this crucial year for the UN system: the post-2015 agenda, the climate change conference in Paris and the first conference that is going to be key, the one in Addis Ababa on financing for development. But we also obviously discussed together the EU-UN partnership on the major crises that are open around us and on which our cooperation is key, starting from the work we do together on Libya, in Syria and we had the chance to get the latest update from his side on the talks he and the UN team have led on Yemen recently.  Obviously we also discussed migration and our decision of today of launching the operation and the work that we are doing together with the United Nations in this respect, in particular in tackling the root-causes of migration flows and the humanitarian consequences of the immense flow of asylum seekers and refugees we are facing in the region - and beyond Europe. We then had two additional points on our agenda. One, we discussed the Middle East Peace Process, the EU role in re-launching the Middle East Peace Process after my visit to Jerusalem and Ramallah one month ago and the visit that some Ministers paid in the region. We will probably come back to that next month with full discussions and conclusions on that. And then we just finished now the point of discussion on the political crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia where the Foreign Ministers endorsed the Council conclusions that will be adopted tomorrow in the General Affairs Council, encouraging all the parties in Skopje to implement the political agreement that was reached on the second of June, in particular in working on implementation of reforms, early elections and the transition that can bring back faith and trust in the institutions by all the people in the country. I stop here, apologies if this time it will be a little bit short. But as you know, we will have a meeting with the Foreign Minister of Iran, Javad Zarif, together with my colleagues from the UK, Germany and France to tackle the last issues open before we hopefully finalise the nuclear deal with Iran by the end of the month.

Statement by the Spokesperson on the continuing detention of Nadiya Savchenko,17.06.2015,17.06.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3324_en,," A year ago, Nadiya Savchenko was captured in eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists. 365 days of detention, most of them in Russia, have severely affected her health. She has repeatedly been denied the core right to fair proceedings. Last week, a Russian court decided to further extend her stay in pre-trial detention until 30 September. Whereas the investigation conducted by the Russian authorities has been closed for months, her trial hasn't been announced yet, thereby unnecessarily prolonging her custody. The European Union firmly calls for her release. This would be in keeping with the ""Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements"" and the commitment to release all hostages and detained persons related to the conflict in Ukraine.

The meeting was chaired by Mr Gunnar Wiegand, Director for Russia, Eastern Partnership, Central Asia Regional Cooperation and OSCE countries, European External Action Service, as the head of the EU delegation. The delegation of Tajikistan was led by Mr Saidrahmon Nazriev, First Deputy Minister for Economic Development and Trade of the Republic of Tajikistan. During the Cooperation Committee, the European Commission reaffirmed its commitment to provide new development funding of €251 million to Tajikistan for the period 2014-2020. The funds will focus on vital sectors for growth and social stability, such as rural development, health, and education. Such support is becoming more urgent, owing to adverse economic developments in Central Asia, such as the fall in foreign remittances from migrant workers in Russia. The Cooperation Committee also reaffirmed the commitment of both parties to strengthen relations in a number of cooperation areas, and took stock of the progress made since the third Cooperation Committee meeting between the EU and the Republic of Tajikistan in Dushanbe in June 2014. The Cooperation Committee reiterated the importance of a comprehensive implementation of the EU Strategy for Central Asia, both on a regional and national basis, and welcomed Tajikistan’s active engagement in the EU regional initiatives for Central Asia. Developments were discussed as relating to the three flagship initiatives of Rule of Law, Education, and Environment; and beyond this, issues of mutual importance such as political and administrative reforms, rule of law and human rights, religious freedoms, trade and economic relations, and border security. The EU called upon the necessity for ensuring human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic reform. The Cooperation Committee emphasised the importance for Tajikistan to further integrate into the world economy, improve the business and investment climate, to ensure adequate social spending to provide basic social services even in times of economic difficulties, and to put in place conditions for medium and long-term growth. The EU appreciates Tajikistan's role in regional cooperation, notably in the areas of border management, customs, trade facilitation and counter narcotics. The Cooperation Council called on the Central Asian partners to search for a sustainable settlement regarding to energy, water management and environment issues in the region, harnessing common water resources for economic development and adopting an integrated approach to resource management taking into account the interest of all the people of Central Asia.

Primer lugar me gustaria dar una calorosa bienvenida a todos y a el Ministro de los Asuntos Exteriores de Ecuador, y amigo Ricardo Patiño. We have been working together in these days and in these last hours to prepare the Summit of tomorrow. Obviously, tomorrow we will have more briefings from our Presidents and we will leave enough space for them to do their job. I believe that today we had a very good meeting with an incredible presence of 61 delegations from Latin America, Caribbean and the European Union to stress the fact that our partnership, our relationship after 16 years, after the meeting in Rio in 1999 has grown stronger. The World has changed. Latin America and Caribbean have changed and the European Union itself has changed, but our partnership is even more relevant and stronger today than it was at that time. I'd like to say that this is also for us, Europeans a crucial part of the transatlantic partnership. We normally focus on the Northern part of the partnership when we mention our Transatlantic ties, but our transatlantic relations are also about our relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. And our two regions are the regions that are the most integrated in the World. From an economic point of view, the European Union is the main investor in Latin America and in the Caribbean.  We have more investments there than in Russia, China and India combined. We are key trading partners for each other and we have economic agreements with 26 out of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries. But our relations, our ties are not only economic and trade ones.  They are mainly social, culture and political. We don't share only history and heritage and past, we share most of all the present and the future. We do have differences, not only among ourselves but also within our regions, this is the strength of democracies and difference in unity. But we have a potential in our partnership that is huge, we have more than one billion people, we are the largest number of democracies in the world for our two regions combined, and we represent one third of the UN membership. So the point is how do we use the huge potential, politically, to contribute to solve some of the problems of our regions of our people and of the world?  I have been personally investing in these first months in office quite a lot in our relationships. I have been travelling to the region three times in the last 6 months:  for the CELAC Summit in Costa Rica, to the Summit of the Americas in Panama and during my visit to Cuba as the first EU  top official visiting the island. And to me, our partnership and the summit shows it very well.  It is not only a strategic one but it  is a special partnership among equals and friends that share a lot. Our Ministerial meeting today, as I said, was very well attended. We had interventions from almost all delegations, mainly on our bi-regional relations and the common challenges we have to face together, to prepare the Summit tomorrow that will reinvigorate our political dialogue and work on the future of our relationship. The main issues of our common work goes towards the new and old global challenges we are facing, starting with climate change, sustainable development, human trafficking, non-proliferation, in particular the nuclear one, combatting illicit drugs trafficking. But also on the economic development, we have common work to do. We believe that Europe, and Latin America and Caribbean, share not only foreign and security policy objectives but also the attention to economic growth, an economic growth that can be inclusive and socially oriented to eradicate poverty and improve access to opportunities and resources on a more equal basis, not only in the world but also within our own societies, within our own communities, on both sides of the Atlantic. So not only an economic development but also a social, political and democratic development is key for us. We have a number of issues on which we concretely work already very well together, and this will be also the issue for the summit tomorrow; our concrete work on facilitating and supporting the exchanges of good practices but also people-to-people contacts, our exchanges of students, our support and common work on Small and Medium Enterprises, our common work on strategic projects like the new optic fibre cable connecting Europe and Brazil and other issues on which we work together. Just let me mention two final things. On one side, I mentioned the people-to-people contacts. At the margins of the Summit, we also have here in Brussels a business summit, an academic forum and a civil society coordination meeting taking place. And today we have jointly signed the establishment of EU-Latin America Caribbean foundation, on the basis of transforming it into an international body that I believe will help us workeven more among our societies. I am sorry I have been even too long. Just one final word to say that we have proposed to our Heads of State and Government tomorrow to task the Foreign Ministers to work more and more closely together, in between the summits, on our political relations, and to work on the common challenges we have also regionally - being it the peace process in Colombia, being it the developments and reforms in Cuba, or the reconstruction of Haiti, just to mention a few. And I believe really our work today has helped prepare the work for the summit tomorrow. And I thank very much Minister Patiño for his excellent support in that.

Statement by the Spokesperson on the fighting around Mariyinka in Eastern Ukraine,04.06.2015,04.06.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3341_en,," The heavy fighting around Mariyinka, near Donetsk, yesterday in Eastern Ukraine constitutes the most serious violation of the ceasefire under the Minsk agreements since February. This escalation followed the movement of a large amount of heavy weapons towards the contact line by the Russia-backed separatists, as reported by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. Renewed intense fighting risks unleashing a new spiral of violence and human suffering. The ceasefire must be fully respected and all heavy weapons withdrawn and kept in storage sites open to regular verification by OSCE monitors. The implementation of the Minsk agreements, to which all sides have declared their commitment, can only succeed on the basis of such a ceasefire, permanent withdrawal of heavy weapons and regular monitoring and verification.

Speech of Head of Delegation Traian Hristea at International Conference – Caucasus 2014 (02/06/2015),02.06.2015,02.06.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/10820_en,,"Your Excellences, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the EU Delegation to Armenia, I would like to welcome all of you at today's International Conference ""Caucasus-2014"", which is annually organised by the Caucasus Institute. 2014 was a year of major challenges in the EU’s neighbourhood. Events in Ukraine, as well as increasing pressure on other eastern partners, put Europe’s political realities into focus. These events have been caused by an increasingly assertive Russian foreign policy, which has also resulted in exacerbating divisions between Russia and the EU. Within the Eastern Partnership in 2014, three Association Agreements including Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements were signed with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, and privionally applied, with the exception of the DCFTA with Ukraine. This new generation of agreements put in place the most ambitious contractual relations so far established with neighbourhood partners. Since April 2014, the visa free regime with Moldova has been operating effectively and facilitating travel, business and people-to-people contacts. In October 2014 Armenia signed the Accession Treaty to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), which came into force on 2 January 2015. Such membership in the EEU in itself is not an obstacle for a strong cooperation with the EU. As you may know, following the successful conclusion of the so-called scoping exercise on possible areas of cooperation for future relations, the European Commission on 19 May adopted a recommendation for the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations on a legally binding framework agreement between the European Union and Armenia. While increasingly taking a differentiated approach to each of its partners, the Eastern Partnership is inclusive in nature, taking into account the commitment of the EaP partners to shared values and necessary reforms. The Eastern Partnership strives to be equally relevant to all partners, regardless of the level of ambition they pursue in their relations with the European Union. At the same time, in recognition of the changing situation in the Neighbourhood, partners’ differing aspirations for their relations with the EU under the ENP, and the difficulty for the ENP to respond to some of these changes, a Joint Consultation Paper was adopted on 4 March 2015, launching a formal consultation process for the review of the ENP, which should be completed in the fall of this year. On May 21-22, the Eastern Partnership Summit took place in Riga which took stock of achievements since the last Summit in Vilnius and the way forward of the EaP. The Summit demonstrated that the EU continues to engage with all six of our independent and sovereign partners, whatever their individual level of ambition in terms of relations with the EU. The Summit reaffirmed increased differentiation in our bilateral relations with each of the six partners, based on Partners' own desires and interests.  This differentiation will help maintain the partnership inclusive as it is equally relevant for those partners seeking a European perspective, as for those that are members of the Eurasian Economic Union, or pursuing another approach. The Summit was accompanied by a number of side events, demonstrating that the Eastern Partnership goes beyond intergovernmental relations to involve civil society, media, business and other stakeholders. Last year it was also the 20th anniversary of the 1994 ceasefire agreement in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict against the background of a continued stalemate. The security situation on the ground remained a matter of serious concern amid incidents and casualties on a level not seen since 1994, an increase in confrontational rhetoric and a continued arms race. The EU continued to fully support the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs and peace-building activities, including through the new EU Special Representative (EUSR) for the South Caucasus and the conflict in Georgia, Herbert Salber. He regularly visited the region for high-level meetings and maintained frequent contacts with relevant interlocutors. Thank you very much for your attention and I wish you a fruitful discussion.

"Statement by the Spokesperson on a new Russian law on ""undesirable"" non-governmental organisations",24.05.2015,24.05.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3355_en,," The new law on ""undesirable"" non–governmental organisations enacted by the Russian president on Saturday 23 May is a worrying step in a series of restrictions on civil society, independent media and political opposition. This law will have a further negative impact on the work of civil society in Russia. It will restrict freedom of speech and media as well as pluralism of opinion, as pointed out by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatović on 20 May. We note the negative opinion of the Russian Presidential Council on Human Rights, as the law also contradicts the Russian constitution. Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative Federica Mogherini following the Defence and Foreign Affairs Council,18.05.2015,18.05.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5550_en,,"Check against delivery Last month, actually less than one month ago, we met in Luxembourg with the Foreign Ministers and the Interior Ministers together, just a few hours after the latest tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea. Today we have had a long day of work with the Defence and Foreign Ministers together. It was the first time after quite some years – I think the last one was in 2012 – that we have had a joint meeting of Defence and Foreign Ministers. We had on the agenda first of all the preparation of the June European Council on the Common Security and Defence Policy. We had a discussion with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on our cooperation and our common work on the new security strategy of the European Union. After this press conference we will continue, with Foreign Ministers only, to discuss the Middle East Peace Process just before my trip to Jerusalem and Ramallah on Wednesday and Thursday. One point of our common agenda, Defence and Foreign ministers together, was the follow-up of the special European Council we had on 23 April. It asked for quick, urgent action on European level to face the tragedies at sea in the Mediterranean, that represent both a humanitarian and a security challenge, first of all for Europe but also for the region, for the Arab world and also for the African countries. Heads of State and Government, less than one month ago, stated the need to act urgently and jointly as Europeans. The need to act is clearly on different levels, with a plurality of actions, with a plurality of elements. And we know very well, we discussed this with the Ministers today again, that not one single action will be effective alone. All elements are important, in connection with each other. That is why we talk about a comprehensive approach where all different parts of our action are relevant. Saving lives at sea - that is why we decided to reinforce Triton and Poseidon - and also on land; working on the root causes, in partnership with our partners in the African Union and in the Arab world, and in particular working on poverty, wars, crises. And dismantling the criminal networks that are smuggling and trafficking people.  All of these in a comprehensive way – with some internal actions and some external actions. The internal actions are obviously under the direct responsibility of, on the Council side, the Interior ministers. On the Commission side, the EU agenda on migration was adopted as you know last week. Commissioner Avramopoulos shared with us this presentation today. But the focus today was obviously on the external part of our work to implement the decisions taken at the European Council in April. On external action, we have three different elements: First, increased partnership with the African Union, with countries of origin and transit - just yesterday we were discussing it with Turkey, increasing the level of cooperation on managing flows of migrants. Second, the decision to increase our presence with the already existing CSDP missions and operations. EUCAP Sahel Niger has been discussed and it has been decided already to increase our presence there last week. And the last element, among many others, that the Heads of State and Government asked of me last month: to prepare a possible CSDP operation to dismantle the business model of trafficking organisations in accordance with international law. Today, less than one month later, we have adopted the ""Crisis Management Concept"" and the decision to establish the operation with headquarter in Rome and with Commander, Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino. The operation will consist of four phases. The decision we have just taken to establish the operation will be public  so you will have the chance of looking at that yourself. This will allow us to start the operational planning with the Commander and in the headquarter and to prepare for the launch of the operation itself. Hopefully already at the next Foreign Affairs Council in June we might be ready to adopt the launch of the operation, on the basis of the recommendations of the preparatory work that the Commander will be doing in the coming weeks. In the meantime, obviously, the work in the UN Security Council will continue in strong coordination with the EU Member States of the Security Council.  We discussed obviously also about this. And I hope that in the meantime the Security Council's resolution under chapter 7 can be adopted so that by June, at the Foreign Affairs Council,  we might have the legal framework for launching the operation in all its phases. You will look at the Council decision and you will see that not all the phases will require the Chapter 7 resolution. But obviously, as we refer to taking decision in accordance with the international law, for us it is extremely important to have that international framework in place and also a framework of cooperation with the Libyan authorities. Let me stress one thing, and then I stop: I think this is an absolute record in terms of timing. Taking the decision to establish a European Union operation in less than one month is,  I think, an absolute record in terms of time. It doesn't only mean that we have done a good team work, and I would like to thank all the services, not only in Brussels, but also in the capital cities  and in good coordination with New York. This tells me most of all that when we have the political will and the determination to act quickly, we can do it. So the European Union can act together and can act in a fast proper way if the strong political will and the will to work together as a team, as Europeans, is there. This is just the beginning of it, a decision to establish an operation means that this will now enable the operational planning to start, including the force generation. Then I hope the operation will be ready to be launched - and this will depend mainly on Member States - already in June. Q&A Q. A number of your former colleagues, Foreign Affairs Ministers of many Members States, your colleague Mr Solana and others, asked you to review the approach towards the region, mainly to set a mandatory deadline for the agreement to establish the two-state solution, and also a kind of equivalence between Israel as a state, and Palestine to be a state also, so that on the negotiation table they could negotiate with each other. Ahead of your visit, what is your message to the Israeli Government? And what is your view on the need for a new European approach towards the Middle East Peace Process? Thank you for the question. First of all, the main request of that letter, of that group of eminent people as they signed themselves, is to have a European Union focus on this. I would say, protagonism of the European Union on the Middle East Peace Process as such is something that I think we are already putting in place. You will remember that my first visit after taking office was to Jerusalem, Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Gaza, and I think I will be the first one to visit the new Israeli Government, being there on Wednesday and Thursday. I am not completely sure, because I don't have the official schedule of the meetings of the Israeli Government, but in any case my very early visit has a political meaning. And the political meaning is that the European Union as such is ready and willing to play a major role in re-launching a Peace Process on the basis of the two-state solution. So my main message to the region, to the interlocutors there will be - obviously now we will discuss it with the Foreign Ministers, so I will also listen to their views - this: count on the European Union to work with our partners in the region and the international community to support a re-start of the Peace Process, working closely with the US, with the UN, with Russia, in the Quartet, but also with the actors of in the region. And listening to their perspectives, to their intentions on how to overcome the status quo. Because I believe that one thing is clear to everybody in the region -that the status quo is not an option. My message will be: European Union is there to play a role. The second message is: tell me what is your idea to overcome the status quo that in itself will not solve the situation, it might actually lead to further deterioration of the situation on the ground. I will be there to listen and to understand how we can help re-launching the process. I will also be accompanied by our new EU Special Representative Fernando Gentilini, who will travel with me with a one-way ticket and stay in Jerusalem to continue the work. Q. Both you and others today have talked about getting support for this operation from Libyan authorities. Can you give us a little bit of clarity on what kind of consent you are looking for, does it need to be backed by Tripoli and by Tobruk, in what form? And secondly, I wondered if you have some concern, yes this has moved very quickly, but there is a lot of effort going on, this operation, which looks at one part of the migration problem, at the same time we have Islamic State seemingly spreading its influence within Libya. Does there need to be more done, does the EU need to start looking again about what to do about Islamic State in Libya? When it comes to the partnership with Libyan authorities to tackle this issue: first of all, let me be very clear on this, I have done this publicly already, I have met with our Libyan counterparts, all of them, when I was visiting them in Tunis.  We are looking for partnership in this, because there is a responsibility that the EU can take, but there is first of all, a responsibility that the Libyans themselves have to take on their territory, their borders, be it land borders or sea borders. We are looking for partnership. The work is underway, especially on the UN Security Council resolution to find a legal basis under Chapter 7 and for the work we will develop in the planning of the operation. This will take place in the UN framework -which is not the EU framework-, and work on a request from what is the legitimate Government sitting in the UN, which is Tobruk. But I would like to add, it is my firm conviction, and we share that with the Ministers, that we need to work also with other relevant authorities in Libya, being that of Tripoli, being that of Misrata, being that of the municipalities, because we will need to share responsibility and also to work together in concrete terms to dismantle the networks. And, obviously the municipalities in particular might have an important role to play in identifying and in cooperating with us in working on this from a very concrete point of view. Let me also say that we are doing the work of the drafting of the resolution itself. It is the responsibility, in this moment of the UK, that is the penholder in the Security Council. We are coordinating in an incredibly positive way - I shouldn' t say incredibly probably - but in a very positive way, among the EU Member States, the ones sitting in the Security Council, the ones that are not sitting in the Security Council. Italy is playing a special role obviously in this. We are coordinating the work, but obviously it is the main responsibility of the EU Member States sitting in the Security Council to do the drafting, even if we coordinate a lot on this. And, to coordinate with the work of Bernardino Leon in this, because our main focus remains that of supporting the final steps, hopefully final steps, of the dialogue efforts. The very same visit I did in Tunis was done together with him to support the process that the UN is leading. And hopefully, this will be the perfect, closer to perfect, scenario to have a National Unity Government in Libya with whom we partner in this and also on the terrorist spread in the country. I have said several times, there are two issues on which it is a matter for the European Union interest and urgency to work. One is the smuggling and trafficking of human beings through Libya, the other one is the spread of terrorist networks. We need to work, obviously, also on that. That is typical, once you move fast on one track, you are asked: shouldn't you go as fast on this track also on the other one. For sure, we also need to work on that, but again, there will be no real solution to the spread of Da'esh in Libya until we will have a Unity Government in the country. That is my firm conviction; this is also our common position. That is why we are doing this hand-in-hand with Bernandino and with the UN process. Q. La distruzione dei barconi è ancora priorità della missione CSDP? Sull'allarme lanciato dal consigliere di Tobruk che tra i rifugiati nel Mediterraneo potrebbero nascondersi dei combattenti dell'Isis dopo un accordo fatto con gli scafisti vorrei sapere se avevate informazioni in questo senso. Abbiamo analizzato il legame possibile e potenziale tra le organizzazioni dei trafficanti e le organizzazioni terroristiche, non posso confermare nessun tipo di collegamento a noi noto. È chiaro però che soprattutto il sistema di business dei trafficanti, il movimento di denaro intorno al traffico di esseri umani potrebbe andare a finanziare attività che potrebbero avvicinarsi ad attività terroristiche. Rispetto alla distruzione dei barconi, quello a cui facciamo riferimento è nella terza fase dell'operazione, la prima fase riguarda la ricerca e condivisione di informazioni e di intelligence che sarà di per se' un elemento di  deterrenza e un elemento fondamentale per passare alle successive fasi. C'è poi una seconda fase di blocco e ispezione dei barconi. C'è una terza fase che riguarda il rendere non utilizzabili i barconi. Come sapete il testo della dichiarazione finale del Consiglio Europeo parlava chiaramente di distruggere, c'è stata una discussione a questo riguardo, il punto fondamentale non è tanto la distruzione, il punto fondamentale è la distruzione del sistema di business dei trafficanti, del modello di business dei trafficanti, l'organizzazione stessa e chiaramente il rendere impossibile per le organizzazioni criminali che fanno soldi sulla disperazione della gente, riutilizzare gli strumenti attraverso i quali si arricchiscono e fanno morire le persone, quindi la concentrazione non è sulla distruzione delle barche, ma è sul rendere non riutilizzabili gli strumenti di morte. Q. Ci sono stati dei distinguo, delle prese di distanze sul problema delle quote di rifugiati nella ripartizione. Volevo sapere dal suo punto di vista che margini ci sono di composizione trattandosi di un problema antico e ci sono posizioni consolidate. Oltre ciò, perché non si parla mai di immigrati clandestini? Ci stiamo concentrando sui rifugiati che sono un problema di alcuni Paesi, a partire dalla Germania, mentre sul problema degli immigrati clandestini che sono un problema egualmente grande per alcuni Paesi della fascia Mediterranea come l'Italia non vediamo al momento delle proposte concrete, quando si affronterà questa parte del problema? Questa parte del problema, così come le altre sono contenute nell'agenda sull'immigrazione che è stata presentata e discussa dalla Commissione la scorsa settimana, dall'altra parte della strada, in Commissione. Anche perché ho tenuto a sottolineare all'inizio: qui oggi avevamo i Ministri degli Esteri e della Difesa e sarebbe stato ben strano se i Ministri degli Esteri e della Difesa oggi avessero deciso o discusso sia la questione dell'immigrazione irregolare sia la questione delle quote che è chiaramente competenza dei Ministri dell'Interno e del Commissario Avramopoulos. Questoinfatti è stato oggetto della discussione all'interno delCollege la settimana scorsa e sarà oggetto della discussione dei Ministri dell'Interno tra qualche settimana. È chiaro però, dal mio punto di vista, quello dell'azione esterna, è chiaro che quando i capi di Stato e di governo hanno concluso il consiglio il 23 aprile, chiedendo tra le altre cose anche una migliore condivisione della solidarietà e della responsabilità interna, hanno in qualche modo invitato la Commissione a fare una proposta che andasse in questa direzione. Posso dire che con i nostri interlocutori internazionali, a partire dalle Nazioni Unite, a partire dall'UNHCR, a partire dai nostri partner nell'Unione Africana, nel mondo arabo, mettiamo sul tavolo anche la presa di responsabilità maggiore dell'Unione Europea rispetto all'accoglienza e alla condivisone del peso dell'accoglienza, troviamo una reazione che riconosce una credibilità maggiore all'Unione Europea, anche perché stiamo parlando di alcuni Paesi, penso alla Giordania o al Libano, che ospitano un milione, un milione e mezzo di rifugiati e hanno una popolazione e un P.I.L. minore rispetto a quello di molti paesi europei. Dopodiché questo non significa, vorrei chiarirlo, che c'è una politica della porta aperta o che può esserci appunto una revisione in questo senso, tutt'altro. Si tratta semplicemente di dire: la priorità così come decisa dai capi di Stato e di governo il 23 aprile, quella di salvare vite umane, dobbiamo affrontare e porci il tema di cosa facciamo delle vite umane che salviamo, nel pieno rispetto della legalità internazionale, questo è un tema non per i Ministri degli Esteri e della Difesa, come ovvio, è un tema per i ministri dell'Interno, per i capi di Stato e di governo, quando abbiamo presentato l'agenda per l'immigrazione della Commissione, c'era una parte relativa a questo capitolo, c'è una consapevolezza che io vedo negli Stati Membri del fatto che è una risposta da dare. La proposta della Commissione sarà poi discussa non certo dai Ministri degli Esteri e della Difesa ma dai Ministri dell'Interno ovviamente. Q. Two quick questions if I may. Did the Ministers agree to a general deadline for pledging their force generation contributions because that is traditionally what delays the actual launching of CSDP operations. So was there a deadline agreed? Secondly, there is no little risk thatgetting cooperation from your Libyan counterparts could drag well beyond June, so what were the political guidelines discussed today in terms of how close a CSDP operation  could come to or go into Libya's territorialwaters? You are right on the risk of delaying, that is why I said ""hopefully"" by the next Foreign Affairs Council, this is not in my hands. This will depend on the preparation, on the planning and on the force generation. And also on the legal framework path, on the work of the United Nations Security Council. But I would say that there is a clear sense of urgency in this respect, also because we all know very well that June is the beginning of summer, and in these operations, seasons are important. And as summer comes, more people are travelling, and we want to have, at least I would like to have, the operation in place as soon as possible, if it has to deter traffickers and smugglers organisations.  On the rest, the planning that is going to start by tomorrow will go more in details. Thank you and see you next time. Link to the video: http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I103422 Bruxelles"
"Remarks by the High Representative/Vice-president Federica Mogherini at the press conference following the briefing of the UN Security Council, New York",11.05.2015,11.05.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5568_en,,"Check against delivery Thank you very much. First of all, let me thank not only the Presidency of the Security Council this month, but also all the European Union members of the Security Council for the excellent cooperation we have established on this issue. I think it tells a lot of the unity of purpose of Europeans, on a tragedy that is at the same time a moral and political duty, that of saving lives, and also a political investment in our collective security when it comes to dismantling smugglers' organisations and trafficking networks. I have obviously briefed the Security Council on the recent decisions and the preparations on the next steps that are underway in the EU. I found a very high level of understanding and sharing of our concerns, of our sense of urgency, of the need to act and to act quickly and together in full cooperation, in full partnership. Not only on fighting the smugglers' organisations, but also in addressing the root causes of the phenomenon, all the way from the countries of origin, with poverty and conflicts at the basis of this phenomenon, all the way through the countries of transit up to the shores of the Mediterranean and the final, sometimes tragic, end of it. I have had an interesting, deep, very fruitful and positive discussion with the Members of the Security Council. Later, I would expect the Security Council to work, in the coming days, for the follow-up. On our side, in the European Union, the Commission will adopt on Wednesday a new agenda for migration that will suggest proposals to solve some of the short-term and long-term issues related to migration in all its aspects - including suggestions to share responsibility within the European Union in a more effective way, but also increasing the effectiveness of legal migration ways. I also mentioned to the Security Council that next Monday, in exactly one week from now, I will propose to the Foreign and Defence Ministers of the European Union to take the first decisions on the European Union operation to dismantle traffickers' organisations, smugglers' organisations at sea. Thank you very much; I am ready for your questions. Q: Russia has made quite clear that they are against any kind of destruction of these boats; I believe you were just asked about this by Russia in consultation. What was your answer, did you elaborate further on what this exact plan is? Destroying the boats on shore or do you think there is a way around this and when do you hope the SC could adopt a resolution to back this operation? I hope as soon as possible. On destroying vessels, the crucial thing for the EU, is destroying the business model of the trafficking and smuggling organisations. Making sure that the vessels cannot be used again, making sure that the assets of these organisations are destroyed. Destroyed in a larger sense. I think that on this, on the need to dismantle the model, dismantle the networks and their assets, there is a large consensus, about the need to act quickly, and together as an international community. One of my main messages today has been that finally the EU is realising that it has to take more responsibility in this, in a very active and big way. We are doing that. And now that same level of awareness, of the need to work together on the global scale has to be shared here, by the Security Council, by the UN system and at the international level, because this is not only a problem for the Mediterranean, this is not only an issue for the Europeans, this has to be also an issue that we need to tackle at a global level, and the UN system is for us the point of reference for that. Q: The UN envoy said that it would be a moral failure not to concentrate on rescuing lives. I wonder if you can say whether the European Union plans to do more to step up the ""search and rescue"" operations and additionally, are there any plans to open up more refugee resettlement places or take in, offer more humanitarian visas for refugees seeking asylum . As I said, the day after tomorrow, we will adopt in the Commission, in the College in Brussels, our new agenda for migration. I will not share details about that with the media before we take the formal decision in Brussels, but we are working on both elements you mentioned, yes. And I fully share the comments that were made by UN Special Representative, when saying that we need to take also responsibility for the people we save. We are increasing our presence at sea. On this I can give you details, because the decision was already taken. We decided to triple the funding for the operations we have at sea at the moment, Triton and Poseidon, in particular. So, this means tripling the funding and the assets present at sea. This would mean, obviously, a very strong increase of the ""Search and Rescue"" operations. But at the same time we have to increase the level of protection of people we save, and for this, obviously we have a European responsibility that we are ready to take. As Commission, we are advancing proposals; I hope the Member States of the European Union will support, and obviously, also in partnership with the relevant UN bodies. In particular I am working very closely with Antonio Guterres, High Commissioner for Refugees, to make sure that we work hand in hand, to not only save lives - which is objective number one for us-, but also to protect the people we save. Q: Last week the head of the Italian Red Cross was here, Francesco Rocca, and he talked to the journalists, he had a meeting also with the Secretary-General. He was not agreeing on the fact that destroying the vessels or having as a first goal to dismantle the traffickers was going to help the people, the migrants, because this is a way to let them die, without we saving them. What is your solution? Ok, you are going to destroy those vessels, what will happen to the thousands of people that reach Libya. Francesco Rocca said that they become slaves there. As I have said many times, and at the very beginning here, and also in the Security Council, our approach is not focusing on one aspect only. We know that we have to tackle all the aspects of this tragedy, which means first and foremost, solve the issues that are at the root causes of people fleeing, and people leaving their country: conflicts, poverty, inequalities, and violations of human rights. Second, we have to tackle the whole route they travel, all the way. We see only the tragedy at sea, but every step of the journey is a tragedy itself. We have to work - and we are working more and more- with the countries of transit and with the UNHCR and with the IOM to make sure that people are not only intercepted but saved and taking care of all the way during the journey of desperation. Dismantling the traffickers and the smugglers organisation is a way of saving lives. I don't believe that people are less of slaves if they are stopped or kept somewhere during the journey or locked in a boat that sinks. It's another way of not seeing people dying, also if we pretend that people are not used in an extremely cynical way by those who are making money out of the desperation. We have to face this, because this is not going to go away by itself. We have to face the reality that there are criminal organisations, criminal networks, working cross borders, with very good connections one with the other, making a lot of money that could go to finance other kind of activities and that are making people slaves out of their desperation. They sell hope, but instead of hope then they deliver death.  We have to face this, otherwise we are not living up to our human dignity, for my point of view. Obviously this doesn't mean that we don't have to face also the problem of taking care of the people we save, as I've said. This is something that at the European Union level, we can do, in increasing our responsibility in welcoming refugees, in welcoming people who are fleeing. I always say, as a mother, that one could chose to leave with her daughters or with her sons, bringing all the money that a family has accumulated in maybe one or two generations, while knowing very well that you could be facing death, you and your children; this means that you have more than a strong motivation to leave. But at the same time we have to make sure that these people are not only paying money but are not also paying with their own lives in the hands of criminal organisations. So here today what I have found is, in all the Security Council Members, a strong political will to do two things at the same time and this is exactly our approach: saving lives, on one side and dismantling the criminal organisations that organise smuggling and trafficking. The two things have to go hand in hand. On Libya. I have personally talked to all sides that are at the moment being involved in the Libyan dialogue. I was in Tunis to meet them ten days ago and I have discussed this directly with them and also today with the Libyan ambassador. What I see is that all sides in Libya understand that our intention is to work on this with them in partnership. Also because this is, first of all, a Libyan interest and a Libyan responsibility - to act to control that territory, to control that border and to make sure that people are not made slaves on their own territory. So dismantling these organisations is also a responsibility of the Libyan authorities. We are working hand in hand with Bernardino León to make sure that the dialogue process brings results. I have said it very clearly in the briefing to the UN Security Council, for us the real solution would be to be able to partner with a government of National Unity in Libya to allow them to control their land borders and sea borders and to work with the relevant UN organisations to make sure that refugees and migrants are being taken care of in an appropriate way. In the meantime we cannot wait, we have to seek support from the different Libyan authorities to partner with us and with the rest of the International community in saving lives and fighting the criminal organisations.  The response that I have had from different interlocutors on different Libyan sides for the moment has been positive and constructive. Then, the ways in which this can be translated into the UN formulas, this is something I leave to the members of the UN Security Council itself. Q. L'ambasciatore libico all'ONU rappresentante del governo di Tobruk, ha detto che il suo governo non è stato ancora consultato sul piano europeo. Ha in programma di incontrarlo? L'ho già incontrato questa mattina prima della sessione del Consiglio di Sicurezza. Gli ho raccontato dei miei incontri a Tunisi qualche giorno fa che chiaramente hanno coinvolto tutte le parti in questo momento impegnate nel dialogo condotto da Bernardino León, chiarito il fatto che, come avevo già fatto nei miei colloqui 10 giorni fa, le intenzioni dell'Unione Europea sono quelle di collaborare, di lavorare insieme alle autorità libiche il più possibile, tutte le autorità libiche. Vorrei sottolineare in questo un ruolo particolare che le municipalità e i sindaci possono avere per smantellare le organizzazioni criminali per una ovvia conoscenza del territorio e anche per una vicinanza alla popolazione civile che è direttamente interessata perché non dimentichiamoci che questi sono traffici che hanno anche una ripercussione importante sulla sicurezza e la stabilità di intere comunità a livello territoriale, quindi c'è, da parte libica, per quello che io ho registrato nei miei contatti diretti, sia qui che a Tunisi 10 giorni fa, una volontà di lavorare insieme, non soltanto all'Unione Europea, ma insieme alla Comunità Internazionale. Vorrei anche dire che il lavoro in questo senso viene fatto certamente da me, da noi, ma ancora di più insieme a Bernardino León perché dev'essere chiaro a tutti a partire da tutte le parti libiche che questo lavoro rientra nel lavoro del dialogo politico che le Nazioni Unite stanno facilitando e che l'Unione Europea sostiene non soltanto convintamente ma anche molto attivamente. Q. Sarà dell'Italia la leadership della missione libica? Questo lo decideremo la settimana prossima a Bruxelles. Q. Intercepting the smugglers, where do the people in the boats, refugees and migrants, will arrive, Italy or another EU country? I said it, I hope very clearly, in the UN Security Council: no one will be sent back against their will. Our intention is to work in full respect of relevant international laws so this is clearly what it's going to happen. No push back, no one will be sent back against their will as it is already the case, now with the people we save with our operation at sea, this is for us a must. Q. Of course, this is a long process and please, make it clear if you may. Do you need the ok to come from the Libyan government in order for the European ships to enter Libyan waters, or no? And are you discussing such an agreement or any kind of discussion with the Libyan Government on that and what's the result on this please? Thank you Heads of States and governments stated very clearly that we will act within the international law framework.  This means, in relationship, in cooperation with the Libyan authorities, and possibly with a UNSC resolution - the two of them. Q. (unclear) What are the odds, is it important for you to get a unanimous resolution? What do you think of an opinion such as the one of Angola that think that this is a too tough and heavy military solution? We discussed with him very openly and I think we share the view that there is not a military solution to a crisis that is not military. I am talking about a naval operation. Q. (unclear) Do you intend to act even without a UN resolution? There are first steps that we are planning and that could be done before a UNSC resolution - I will not go more in detail as the discussion is still ongoing in Brussels and the decision still needs to be taken by the Member States. But there are steps that we will take and we made it very clear to the Security Council Member States. There are steps that the European Union will take in full respect of international law, even before a UNSC resolution is adopted.  But I am quite confident today, from the level of understanding, awareness and political will that I found here in the Security council, that it is possible to obtain a resolution in a reasonable future. Q. Please elaborate on the resistance from Russia, and how the European Union could help overcome it? I've not found resistance from any of the Member States of the Security Council. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to do to reach a resolution. I understand that a draft will be shared with all Members in the coming hours; this is obviously not a work for the European Union as such. You know very well that the European Union is not seating in the Security Council.  But for once, we are coordinating very closely as Europeans;  this makes it clear that the text that is being worked on by the Europeans, in this case, is a reflection of a common European perspective and coordinated very strongly among us and with Brussels - and is also shared by all 28 Member states of the European Union. I have not found in my discussions today - as well as I didn't find any opposition in my discussions in the previous days- both with Russians or other authorities an opposition to this. There is still a lot of work to be done on the text, on drafting a text that included the details. This is the work to be done here, but in principle, I've not found an opposition to act as I said on the two elements, of saving lives but also fighting the criminal organisations. The point of reference is and stays the one of the anti-piracy operation that received a green light from the Security Council, off the coast of Somalia. Q. Your answer is that it is not only a military operation, that the human aspect is very important and then you say that we have to go on the root causes of people migrating, why they are leaving the country of origin. What do you say today at the United Nations in order to make the people stop leaving wherever they are leaving to their dangerous journey to go toward Libya? What will Europe do to make them stop, to protect them and help them, in their existential problem their home. What can you say now? I'm afraid that what I can say now might not convince them to stop. Especially because the people that are leaving are coming from crisis areas, from conflict areas. And I'm afraid that there is nothing I can say to someone leaving from Syria, or from areas of conflict nowadays. What I can say to them is we, as Europeans, I add personally, finally, understood that we have to take this seriously, and together as Europeans. On different elements - preventing and managing conflicts - the main point is Syria there, but not only. Majority of the people come from the Horn of Africa. But it is not only an issue of conflicts, it's an issue of respect of human rights, and it's an issue of inequalities and access to economic, financial and natural resources. We are increasing our work with the countries of origin, in the cases where the people are leaving the countries for poverty. We are increasing our level of cooperation with the countries of transit for the people who are leaving the countries because of war and conflict - because in that case, working with the authorities of the countries in war, doesn't really solve the problem for the people deciding to leave. The important thing is that we are increasing the level cooperation with the UNHCR to make sure that the points where these people can be welcomed and somehow addressed to, is as close as possible to the point of departure. Because the longest the trip is, the most dangerous it is for them, the more lucrative it is for the organisations and the more difficult it is to operate on this. So, what we are trying to do, is to approach as much as we can the points where people can address to, in their cases, the majority of these people are people that qualify for the international protection so the cases can be examined. And that we are increasing our presence at sea to save their lives; but this is not the solution to their problem. Their problem needs to be solved with the different global, not only European, responsibilities. Taking major responsibility in welcoming people that are getting out of crisis and conflict areas. This is going to be the solution.  This is the message but it's not going to change from today to tomorrow. The point is, they have to be aware of the fact that leaving means financing criminal organisations, cynical, without any scruples, and ready to make a lot of money out of their desperation. This is the message that I feel giving to them, I think many of them know and still decide to leave. This tells us, in our part of the world, how deep our responsibility and our action have to be and most of all, how urgent it has to be dealt with. Because we cannot wait for another tragedy of major scale to happen again. That's why I came here today, second time in ten days, to pass the message to the UNSC. Europe has probably for once, waken up. We need the rest of the world to do their part as well. Thank you very much.  Link: New York"

"Keynote address of the High Representative and Vice-president at Leiden University, the Netherlands",16.04.2015,16.04.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3462_en,," Good evening. It is a pleasure to be here at Leiden University’s The Hague Campus. A place that brings together the best of two worlds: with centuries of academic tradition – founded in 1575, Leiden is one of Europe’s leading universities. This campus here in The Hague – the seat of so many international organisations – also demonstrates a true openness to the world. I can't see a better place to reflect about Europe’s global role, history and future. We meet here in challenging times. Today our world is much more connected than just a decade ago. In these days, at the Global Conference on Cyberspace, we work on the many opportunities, but also the great risks this brings. Our world today is also much more conflictual and complex than we used to imagine. What is so dangerous is not just the sheer number of simultaneous crises and that alone would be more than enough to worry. Many of these conflicts undermine the very foundations of the cooperative global order we aim at. The illusion about the “end of history” is long gone. Over the last decade, many have bet on a state of perennial conflict. A global disorder in which international laws and human rights are empty words. In which extremists prosper and impose terror on entire populations. Today, instability has once again reached our doorstep. Someone still believes we could simply lock ourselves into our “fortress Europe”. Well, let me say this is an illusion. The kind of world we live in would never allowed us to do so. We live in an interconnected world. Our fundamental interests and values are at stake. The values for which past generations have fought so tirelessly, the values upon which our European Union was built: peace, democracy and human rights. Over the past decades we have made amazing progress in Europe to anchor these values deep in our societies. It looks natural now, but if we look back we see war and the worst atrocities where now there is peace and cooperation: the EU. We should never forget the responsibility that this gives us. And we have enlarged the circle of those who benefit from them. The European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this. The Nobel Peace Prize to the EU was not just for the past, for what we achieved. It is also for what we can still do, for and with our people, for and with our Region, for and with the rest of the world. There is no doubt that, as the nature of challenges evolves, so must our means to address them. But our fundamental beliefs and aspirations, our   commitment to work towards a more peaceful world are and will stay the same – now more than ever. This requires both nerve and staying power. And it requires unity of purpose. What we need is not new principles, but new ways to project them. Let me focus on three areas where only a renewed commitment to our values can promote our interests, protect our security and shape the world we would like to live in – today and for the future. First, in our neighbourhood, where violent conflicts go hand in hand with a battle of ideas. Second, in how we shape our partnerships around the world. And third, in how we plan for the future, how we make the best use of our tools. Nowhere is the urgency to protect our fundamental interests and values clearer than in the crises at our Eastern and Southern borders. We see fundamental principles flouted as borders and national sovereignty are violated. What makes these conflicts so dangerous is that they combine beliefs we thought belonged to a bygone era – the law of the stronger and disregard for individual dignity – with the trappings of the modern age. So the crises we face to our East and to our South are much more than violent confrontations – they are also a battle for hearts and minds. Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty is not just a regional crisis. It is a matter of universal concern. The UN Security Council Resolution on Ukraine is testament to this and the tragic loss of lives in the downing of flight MH17, that has touched so many in this country in such a dramatic way, reminded to the whole of us that this conflict goes to the heart of our own security. Our priority is – and has always been – for the violence to stop. All our efforts are focused on the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. We have engaged in dialogue on all levels, in all formats. At the same time, we have adopted tough sanctions. But sanctions are not an end in themselves. That is why EU leaders have firmly linked restrictive measures to progress on the implementation of the Minsk agreements – above all respecting the ceasefire and removing all heavy weapons from the region. A destabilised and isolated Russia is in no one’s interest. Russia is central, not just to a stable and prosperous Eastern neighbourhood, but also to some of the most pressing issues we face: I think of the Middle East Peace Process and, of course, I think of completing the process towards a comprehensive agreement with Iran on the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. Russia and its people have as much to gain as we do from a world where international law is respected, where people are free to choose their own destinies. A lasting solution to the crisis also depends on Ukraine becoming a functional state that honours the aspirations of its people. That is why the EU works closely with Ukraine on its reform agenda. We give macro-financial assistance to stabilise the country’s finances; we deployed an EU Advisory Mission to assist with security sector reform; and we facilitate negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to ensure secure gas supplies. And we work with the Osce and with the rest of the international community to make sure that the crisis comes to an end, a solution. Strengthening state structures and giving democracy a space to prosper – this is also central to working with our neighbours to the South. Take Libya: the prospect of a failed state at our southern borders is a serious risk to our continent’s security. Actually, difficult to refer to a failed State as we can hardly see a 'State'. Extremists have filled the gap left by the lack of a functioning state. They spread fear and hatred along with terrible violence. Human traffickers exploit the misery of migrants, gambling with innocent lives for their personal gain. What is more, the conflict risks destabilising the entire region, from Maghreb to Sahel, to sub-Saharan Africa. The European Union welcomes the resumption of the national reconciliation talks, mediated by the UN representative Bernardino Leon. We are doing all we can any single day to facilitate the dialogue and will support a national unity government as soon as it is formed. We call on all regional actors to do the same. This is,  believe me, is the main point we have been working on days and nights in the last weeks. Those who keep spreading violence to undermine the talks will have to ask themselves, sincerely: what is the alternative to an inclusive process that unites Libyans against Daesh?. Ultimately, a lasting solution lies in the hands of the Libyan people. In their willingness to save their country, their cities, their people. Not tomorrow but now. As our attention is attracted by new flares of conflict, we should not get used to what has happened in Syria for over four years. The situation today is more desperate than ever. Too many lives have been lost, centuries of culture, the treasures of our common civilization, our joint heritage – destroyed. A generation of displaced children is growing up in refugee camps without access to proper food and healthcare, let alone education. What happened in Yarmouk is one more terrible episode in a humanitarian catastrophe. Faced with so much misery, the EU has focused on the humanitarian dimension of this crisis. We have mobilised more than 3 billion euros to assist Syrians at home, as well as refugees and their host communities in neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, who deserve praise for their solidarity with the victims. But we also need to restart the process towards a political transition and national reconciliation. Again, this process can only be Syrian-led. But we also expect regional powers to stop fostering conflict and to support a mediation among the parties. Peace in Syria will also depend on cooperation among regional stakeholders – including Iran. We will have to work with all our partners in the Region to build a new regional framework to put and end to crisis and prevent terrorist groups to gain ground. Look at Yemen. Over there, Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is trying to fill the vacuum that emerged in a state of increasing lawlessness. We now need to focus all efforts on international mediation. Unilateral solutions cannot work. All these crises point in the same direction: regional powers need to agree on a new order for the Middle East, a peaceful and cooperative one. An order where issues are dealt with at the negotiating table, not via proxy wars. This brings us back to the role of Iran. The framework we agreed on in Switzerland is in itself an important leap towards a comprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme, that would be hugely beneficial in terms of non proliferation, so in terms of security for the Region and the world. But it could also be a first step towards a more positive role for Teheran on the international scene, and possibly to facilitate dialogue in countries destabilised by a decade-long struggle for regional supremacy. And we could have the chance to overcome the false narrative of 'religious clashes' that mask power fights in reality. In the region, as much as right here at home, security is not the only issue at stake when it comes to countering violent extremism. The terrorists seek to revive the stale narrative of a clash of civilisations, while muslims are the first victims of “jihadism” all over the world. The clash runs within civilisations, within Islam itself that is a religion of peace. The daily greeting 'Salamaleikum' says it all: 'May peace be with you'. As the King of Jordan underlined at the European Parliament. Europe stands on the same side as the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world and of the Arab countries. At home as well as abroad, the fight against Da’esh is also about showing that Europe is a land of freedom and opportunities for all Christians, Muslims, Jews and non-believers alike. It is about reaffirming the true nature of the Middle East, with diversity as an integral part of its DNA. It is another battle for hearts and minds. In this battle, reviving the Middle East Peace Process is vital. Peace in the “Holy Places” could lay out the most resounding message against the misuse of religious symbols, for the region and the whole world. Europe’s deep political and economic partnership with Israel and our role as the foremost donor to the Palestinian Authority and UNWRA give us a key position in reinvigorating the peace talks. And it gives us a special responsibility. We need to build a new international consensus to resolve this conflict: the European Union, the United States, Russia and the UN are central pillars of this effort. Our Arab partners in the region also play a key role in supporting a successful peace process: the Arab Peace Initiative provides a vision for a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Above all, both parties need to rebuild trust and refrain from actions that undermine it. Before it is too late for two States to live side by side in peace and security. Before it is too late for entire generations to get lost in hate and dispair. In Israel as in Palestine. The arc of instability is all around us. We live in the most turbolent area of the wold (G7). The situation at our borders demonstrates the added value of a strong and united EU foreign policy. But the sheer scale and complexity of the crises we face tell us something more: we cannot hope to be successful without a global network of partners that share our interests and values. To effectively do so, we need to convince them that working with Europe is not to perpetuate an anachronistic global order that seeks to exclude them from a seat at the table. We need partnerships on an equal footing. This means truly engaging with the concerns that new powers bring to the table, but also a full commitment by all to work towards common solutions. A new world order will not emerge as a zero sum game, where increased influence for some necessarily means decreased influence for others. Influence will be shared, and so will responsibilities. Today the vast majority of challenges we face are common challenges. From security to climate, from poverty to energy. This makes cooperation even more crucial. So in addition to strong bilateral partnerships, we are strengthening our cooperation with regional partners such as ASEAN, the CELAC countries, the League of Arab States and the African Union. Our cooperation with the United States forms the oldest, deepest and strongest of our partnerships. And yet, we cannot afford to neglect this bond. We need to build on our deep historical ties and work towards a common future. And this is something we should do more: look at the future. Not only the immediate one. Look at 10, 20 years from now. To protect our values and enshrine them in any future order, we need to think strategically – more than we ever did, starting with our Region. The fact that the Arab Awakening was not a linear path to freedom and democracy in the region should not lead us to conclude that we should give up. Some processes are slow, difficult, but somehow irreversible. We have to look at the bigger picture and long term. There is no stability without democracy. And there is no security without human rights. So we need to work closely with countries such as Tunisia and Morocco, who are committed to the path of reform. We need to support those, such as Lebanon and Jordan, who face incredible external and internal pressures. Above all we need to invest in the younger generations and give them a stake in our shared future: through education and employment, through freedoms and rights. We need to make sure they have a place in society, in the EU as well as in the southern shore of the Mediterranean. This would be the best way of preventin terrorism. Beyond our neighbourhood, we need to take a fresh look at how we approach our external action. More than a decade after Javier Solana’s European Security Strategy, the world has changed. And we have changed as well. The European Union now has the capacity to be a truly global player. Our European External Action Service was created precisely to enable us to address some of the challenges the Solana Strategy lays out so lucidly. The European Union has a real added value in facing the risks of a rapidly changing world. We are able to draw on a wide range of policies for our external action: from the three d’s (diplomacy, development and defence), to energy and trade, migration and security. In a world where the lines between internal and external threats are increasingly blurred, this is an important unique asset. And what is important and unique is also or unity, the size and weight of an European Union. Alone, we are almost irrelevant in today's world. Together we are a superpower. We now need to connect the dots and think for the long term. If we want lasting solutions, we need to stay engaged even after the eyes of international media turn away from any given crisis spot. We need to combine fast action with patient negotiations; we need to sanction those that threaten the global order and create incentives for working together towards peace. We need hard and soft power. We need conflict prevention and post crises management. Amid the current global chaos, a new external strategy will give us a sense of direction, an ability to make choices and to prioritise. It will also give us a true sense of European ownership: a common vision. That is why I want to include Member States in this process heading to a new European Foreign Policy, defense and security strategy. Not only governments, but also national parliaments, the academia, think tanks and NGOs – the foreign policy community at large. If it has to be our own, common direction, we need to work at it together and share it from the very beginning. Ladies and Gentlemen, dear students, The motto of your university is Praesidium Libertatis. When I was in University, I was convinced that Europe was this Praesidium Libertatis. The European Union has brought us the freedom of opportunities: the freedom to move, to trade, to work – and of course to study. But above all it has brought us freedom from war in our continent. it has not brought us freedom from fear. Looking at the world around us, where conflict is such a pervasive feature, we still have to fight against our own fears. You might call my continued belief in the European project naïve. But the fact that the spectre of war has returned to Europe’s neighbourhood is exactly the reason why we know we need to be together. Because only together we can make sure that the freedom of opportunities that we have built in the last decades can be there also for the future generations and for the present generations all around our borders. Confronted by turmoil and uncertainty, we cannot afford to turn inwards. Now more than ever we need to face our fears and fight the dangers that threaten to undermine our achievements. To promote what we have, to promote opportunities for those that don't have them today and to find again hope in a better future, for us and those around us. So now more than ever we need to work together to ensure that Europe is not a fortress, or a crumbling palace of bygone glories – but truly a 'Praesidium Libertatis' for all . Thank you. Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting,15.04.2015,15.04.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3465_en,," Check Against Delivery! First of all let me thank the German Presidency of the G7 for the excellent meeting we've had in this wonderful setting and with such a rich and complex agenda. We've touched upon all the major crises we have on the international scene. Noticing that most, if not all of them are concentrated around the European Union, so there is a specific role and responsibility for us Europeans to play. Let me say that the main message we had yesterday and today in our discussions was that of the need for unity, being united and coordinated in facing all the crises we're having in front of us, starting from the one in Ukraine, where I would like again to praise the role of Germany and France for the efforts they are making in the implementation and the follow up of the Minsk agreements. Going to Syria and Iraq, Yemen, Libya, those are issues that we have discussed a lot, also in relation to our action against terrorism and on migration, Boko Haram, the work in Sahel and Yemen. And let me finish by saying that we expressed very warm and united support for the negotiations we are carrying on with Iran on the nuclear programme, with the strong message coming from all to continue to finalise the agreement on the basis of the political understanding we reached in Switzerland a couple of weeks ago, by the end of June. This would first of all be an extremely important element for the security of us all, a very important non-proliferation element but also would be important for the regional framework. The Middle East is facing already so many crises that having some positive development would definitely be extremely important for all of us. Obviously in all this the European Union is called upon to play a role, which also implies the unity of the European Union and I will, together with the European friends who were present here today, bring part of the discussions to Monday's Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, where we will discuss, among other things Yemen, Libya - and I will put on the table of the Ministers different options for European Union's support to a national unity government, which we hope can come out of the talks that Bernardino León and the UN are leading in these very same days in Morocco. Thank you very much! Q&A On Ukraine/Russia from La Repubblica. In a statement and in an interview to Die Welt, Mr Steinmeier stressed that he can see the detriment to the West interest to have a long term isolation of Russia, and that is your point of view too. In the G-7 group and generally in the NATO context sometimes you also may have other music, so you've stressed the need for unity but don't you see the risk of diverging between hard liners and less on Russia? No, I know that splits and divergences make the headlines more than unity and I understand your work, but the fact is that over the last year and something when we had to face very difficult situation in our relations with Russia, we've always managed to keep unity, to build unity both on the pressure we have exercised on Russia and on the search for dialogue and for political solution to the crisis within the European Union and between the European Union and its major partners in the G7, mainly with the United States, with Canada, with Japan. We are on the same line: the international principles, the international rules have to be respected and restored; we are investing very much in the success of reforms inside Ukraine and we are strongly believing in the way of the political solution and on dialogue. This is obviously in the interest of all the players that we have gathered here today and it is clearly in the interest of the European Union to solve the crisis in Ukraine, but at the same time it's not in the interest of everyone around the table today and for sure in the European Union to isolate Russia, we've always said, not only Minister Steinmeier, not only myself, but all of us that it would be good to have at a certain point Russia going back to play a responsible role in the international scene as it is doing in other dossiers. I've just mentioned the Iran negotiations where Russia has played a constructive role, the same can be said for the Middle East Peace Process, another issue we discussed today and we worked together with Russia, not only the European Union, but also the United States and others, in the UN framework on many other different challenges and crisis, from counterterrorism to other things. The point is that we want to see the Ukrainian crisis solved and international law restored, but there is no objective to isolate Russia, this is not the goal to isolate Russia at all, and we are all looking forward to Russia coming back to be a responsible player in the international scene, obviously the decision to do to is in the hands of Russia. On Yemen and Libya by Al Arabiya: Does the EU consider President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi still the legitimate President of Yemen, and then if so, then he may deserve the EU support, political support or more than political support?And on Libya, can you tell us that if it is possible that on Monday among the element you will present to the Ministers, do you intend to present some security component in these element to support a possible Unity Government in Libya? Thank you. On Yemen, as I said, I just decided to put the issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday. We will have a discussion with the Ministers. You know very well the European Union position, it has not changed - we believe that we need to find ways of having a political solution to the situation in Yemen. This is very much in line with the position of our other international partners and I am closely in contact with the actors of the region and with the UN to try and see what kind of steps can be made - we discussed that today with the G7 - in order to re-start a political process that can bring to a real solution to the country and to the conflict within the country. When it comes to Libya, I will not anticipate the details of the measures that I will put on the table of the Ministers, but I can tell you already that yes, there is a component of CSDP - as we say in the European Union - which means security and defence component to that. This means that we are ready, as Europeans, to do our part if and when a National Unity Government will be formed. And if and when this National Unity Government will ask for support from the international community and from the European Union, in a framework of strong coordination with the UN, always, that is going on these days and years and months very closely, and obviously in connection with our Arab friends and partners. I discussed this directly with most of the Ministers of the region in Barcelona on Monday: from Egypt to Algeria to Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, with the Ministers of the Gulf. It is very clear that the situation in Libya is an issue first of all in the hands of the Libyans and I hope that they can get the opportunity of the talks that are re-starting in these days, to unite against the threat of Da'esh and terrorist organisations in their country. Libya is a rich country, potentially. Libyan people deserve a better life and an end to the suffering they are experiencing for too long. And I am convinced that the Libyans are ready and can be ready to take responsibility for the future of their own country. In that moment, I want them to know that the European Union, and the other actors of the region will be ready to support and accompany them in rebuilding the country. On Iran and Migrations by AP: Could we have your assessment please of the deal between US administration and Congress, on what it might mean for the Iran negotiations that you have been involved in. Secondly, on the sinking of a boat carrying 400 or more refugees in the Mediterranean, is it time to switch, move away from the very heavy emphasis on policing the Mediterranean and focus more on the rescue now. On Iran, let me say that negotiations in Switzerland were difficult but helped by the fact that all the actors around the table were deeply committed to find an agreement and a good agreement. And I am convinced that in these weeks we have in front of us before we get to the final text of the agreement and the final consensus on the agreement, we will have to make sure that we do, one on hand, a good job in working on the details - and we know that every single detail is also very much political. That is why our staff, our political directors are restarting the work next week already, with the European Union leading role in restarting the negotiations. We want to move forward quickly. And on the other hand, to create the political conditions in the key countries that are part of the negotiations but also in the region to allow a political consensus about this agreement. I am confident that this would be the case both in the United States and in other countries. I was pleased by the welcoming that Minister Zarif and his team received going back to Teheran after the end of the negotiations. I think that we will also need, as Europeans in particular and me personally, to invest a lot in explaining that this agreement is aimed at the security of the whole region because it is a way of making sure that Iran cannot and will not develop a nuclear weapon. This is in the interest of Iran as well. And we have an historical opportunity to not only work for once on a non-proliferation measure, but also to open up the country to normal relations with the rest of the world, open up to trade and investment, with positive developments also I believe for the younger generations in Iran that were the ones that were demonstrating the most in the streets of Teheran when Minister Zarif was going back. And I am confident that the US, not only the US leadership that is very much committed, but also the US Congress, will understand that this agreement is an agreement in the interest of the security of everybody in the region and worldwide also because it can set the precedent for good non-proliferation agreements and deals also in other parts of the world. About the second question, there are different levels of action we have to take when it comes to migration and the flow of refugees across the Mediterranean. The one that is more directly related to my work and to the work of the Foreign Ministers is obviously the mid and long term action we need to take. Because if you look at the numbers of the refugees and of the migrants, they are mostly coming from Syria, Iraq and the Horn of Africa.  And this tells you that we have to solve crises and wars that last for too long and that are the root cause of the people deciding to risk everything and travel, in most cases with very difficult human conditions. Then you look at the second data which is the majority of the flow goes through Libya, which means that the other job we have to do is trying to solve the Libyan crisis in order to make sure that we have the capacity to control the flow of migrants and immigrants and in particular the criminal organisations that are trafficking in human beings. This is true for Libya and this is true also for all the ways that go to Libya. And this is what we are already doing as Foreign Ministers in the European Union: we are increasing the level of cooperation with the countries of origin and transit, in full respect of human rights, but this is what we need to do. Then there is the most immediate action we need to take, this is less in the hands of the foreign policy actors, so it is not my direct responsibility but I have been working in these months with Commissioner Avramopoulos, with Vice-President Timmermans to have a new approach of the European Union to migration policies. There are instruments that European Union has and that can be used more and better, thinking of Dublin Agreement that could be applied in a more complete way for sharing responsibilities. Germany for instance is a country that is hosting a large number of refugees, together with Sweden, maybe this is something that can be shared more with Member States. There are countries like Italy or Malta or some of the Southern countries of Europe that are receiving more migrants and maybe this is also something that through a more complete application of Dublin Agreement can be shared more. So we need more solidarity in Europe. And for sure we also have to be more effective in managing our borders. And obviously this is a responsibility of Member States. But we cannot pretend that it is only and purely a responsibility of Member States. It is also responsibility of the European Union as such and on this also we are working to make sure that we strengthen at the same time the need to save lives - I think this is a human need - to make sure that people don't die at sea and to secure our borders in a more effective way. But you cannot solve the issue only on one level of the actions. And you need to look at all the different layers of measures you have to implement, not only at the national levels but also at European level. As we discussed it here today, with our G7 partners, at an international level. At the end of the day, this is not an issue for one or 28 states, it is a global issue that we cannot pretend not to see. Thank you very much, good bye.

Inaugural trilateral EU-Russia-Ukraine meeting on gas,20.03.2015,,http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4649_en.htm,https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/20141030_trilateral_protocol.pdf,"This site uses cookies.

The European Commission hosted today the inaugural meeting of the trilateral talks with Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the follow-up to the Winter Package. Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič chaired the talks which brought together the Minister for Energy of the Russian Federation Alexander Novak and the Ukrainian Minister for Energy and Coal Industries Vladimir Demchyshyn. The Winter Package on gas supplies to Ukraine signed between the three sides on 30 October 2014 ends on 31 March 2015. At the end of today's talks Vice-President Šefčovič said: ""We have held a constructive first meeting on the follow-up to the Winter Package. I am happy that the parties were able to agree on a joint statement and on the steps forward. On this basis we can work towards a bridging agreement until the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal settles the disputed issues. I am also reassured that the transit gas flows to the EU will remain unaffected."" High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini underlined: ""I welcome that this trilateral meeting on gas supplies to Ukraine has taken place, as called for also by the Declaration in support of the Minsk Agreements on 12 February.   I hope an agreement acceptable to both sides can be found soon, which may contribute to reducing the existing tensions in the energy relations between the two countries."" The Parties agreed that preparations for the supply for the next winter have to start now. To this effect the parties agreed that a group of experts should start working on the details. The working group will present a draft proposal for the next trilateral meeting, foreseen to be held in April 2015. Share this page:"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at the European Council,19.03.2015,19.03.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3307_en,,"Check against delivery We will have a discussion tonight on Ukraine and Russia with the Heads of State and Government. What I can tell you now is obviously that any kind of decision will have to be taken only on the basis of the situation on the ground, as we have already said several times, and only linked to the implementation of the Minsk Agreements in full. We will also have a discussion with the Prime Ministers and Presidents on the situation in Libya. I will report on the discussions and the decisions that have been taken by the Foreign Ministers on Monday and present different contributions that European Union is giving to the process of dialogue. I've just talked about that with Bernardino Leon. The dialogue among different parties in Libya is starting again today in Rabat and we are doing our part in hosting next week a meeting of mayors who are already on their way to Brussels. In this way we hope we will manage to give to the Libyan people, and also to the region, a future not of war and violence, but of stability and peace. We see how much this is needed in the region. I just spoke this morning with the Prime Minister of Tunisia, to give him all the support of the European Union and of the European people, not only in terms of security and measures against these terrorist attacks, but also in support of the economic and democratic transition that the country is going through. The people of Tunisia – and especially the young people of Tunisia – have to know that the European Union is fully with them to give them a future of hope, a future full of – we hope – good things, not violence. And the fact that Tunisia is attacked is a sign against democracy; it is a sign against the future of the region. And this is another reason for supporting Tunisia. I was just in this building two days ago, with the Tunisian Foreign Minister, signing important agreements on our cooperation and we will strengthen it even more now.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the Informal Meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs (Gymnich),06.03.2015,06.03.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3275_en,,"Check against delivery I would like to thank Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs very much for the excellent cooperation in the preparation of this informal meeting and all throughout the Latvian Presidency and for the months still to come which are a long way, especially in view of the Riga summit that we will discuss tomorrow as well. As Edgards said, the discussions we had today with the Ministers - in an informal setting, so no formal decision was to be taken - are preparing the ground for formal decisions in the next Foreign Affairs Council on 16 March and then at the European Council that, as you know, will have on the agenda both Libya and the situation in Ukraine. I would start from the situation in Ukraine. As it was said very well, today we focused mainly on the way in which the European Union can support the implementation of the Minsk agreements, starting from the strengthening of the OSCE mission. The discussions we had with the Secretary General of the OSCE were helpful, not only to assess the situation on the ground, but also to understand what is needed, which means what is lacking at the moment to make it really effective on the monitoring of the ceasefire and on the monitoring of the withdrawal of weapons.  But also the main focus was on the other parts of the implementation of the Minsk agreements, starting from the reform process in Ukraine, being it reforms on the social and economic level, reforms on the political level, the decentralisation process, reform of the constitution, all the way to early local elections as the Minsk agreements foresee. We also shared the need to continue our European Union exercise of trilateral talks with Russia and Ukraine both on energy issues and on the trade issues, in particular the implementation of the trade part of the Association Agreement. We also insisted on the fact that we need to have more effective humanitarian support and access to the West and also to the East of Ukraine and the EU will increase its efforts in this respect. I could not stress our unity more than Edgards has just done. But we are all very much aware of the fact that this is part of our joint strength, be it when we adopt the sanctions, as it has been in the past and it could be in the future if the situation deteriorates, be it our unity on the support of Ukraine, be it also on the political dialogue and on the diplomatic process. We are united on any single action we do, vis à vis Russia, vis à vis the situation in Ukraine. Let me now pass to Libya. It was a very important discussion I think, to prepare the discussion we will have in the Foreign Affairs Council in ten days. We started with the telephone call with Bernardino Leon, who called us from Rabat. He was just in the middle of the negotiations, so reporting the state of play of the talks, quite positive, quite encouraging, even if obviously the process will be still difficult and long. But the very fact that the talks are taking place and are moving forward is definitely a very positive sign that was not a given, and was not taken for granted, over the last months. The European Union is already investing a lot in this process. We are providing financial support to the dialogue that is taking place in Rabat and is a UN-led exercise. e will be hosting on 9 March a meeting of Libyan businessmen in Brussels to make sure that the business community from different sides, different parts of Libya comes together and is able also to express support to the political process, and concerns about the deterioration of the security situation in the country. We need to build the confidence inside the country, starting also from the civil society actors and we know that businessmen and businesswomen are a relevant part of it. We will also have in Brussels a meeting of Libyan municipalities as soon as possible, as soon as the dialogue continues over the next days. We will agree with the UN when the right time to intervene is, but we are already planning a meeting of the municipalities to accompany the process of political dialogue that is now in place in Rabat on the local community level. As well as, as Edgars said, we have started discussing possible European Union contributions, agreed with the UN, with the Arab interlocutors, with other regional actors. The EU contributions would support any possible agreement coming out from the dialogue that is currently under way. All possible support, all possible forms of support, including also missions or operations could be explored in the coming days. I have always said, if the political process starts, if the political process brings to some starting point inside Libya, the international community and the European Union, first of all, will be ready to support with all possible means. So, we started discussing today with the Ministers different options that will come back to the table in ten days for first decisions or further evaluation, depending on where we stand with the process of dialogue. Thank you. Link to the video Riga"
Statement by the Spokesperson on the refusal to allow MEP Sandra Kalniete enter the territory of the Russian Federation,03.03.2015,03.03.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3269_en,,"The refusal to allow Ms Sandra Kalniete, Member of the European Parliament, enter the territory of the Russian Federation has prevented her from attending the funeral of Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered on 27 February in Moscow. Similar entry bans have also affected representatives of EU Member States. The justification given to Ms Kalniete, who holds a diplomatic passport, implies that she represents a threat to the security of the state or to the public order of the Russian Federation. This would not appear to be a credible explanation of the refusal and is not in keeping with the spirit of the Visa Facilitation Agreement between the EU and Russia. Russian authorities should also exercise transparency with regard to travel restrictions. While the European Union is committed to finding a way towards de-escalation, such signals from Russia add new tensions in already difficult times, with the emergence of a trend whereby EU representatives are selectively banned from entering Russia for apparently arbitrary reasons.

Vice-President Mr Maroš Šefčovič today chaired trilateral talks on energy between the EU, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. The Russian Federation was represented by the Minister for Energy, Mr Alexander Novak. Ukraine was represented by the Minister for Energy and Coal Industries, Mr Vladimir Demchyshyn. Vice-President Šefčovič said: ""I am satisfied that we managed to safeguard the full application of the Winter Package for the supply needs in Ukraine. We also agreed to take up trilateral negotiations on the follow-up to the Winter Package. I am reassured that the supply of gas to the EU markets remains secure"". High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini underlined: ""The outcome of today's meeting on energy issues can help bridge differences over the supply of gas between Ukraine and Russia. These efforts are part of the concrete support of the European Union to the implementation of the Minsk Agreements."" The Chair summed up the outcome of the trilateral meeting in the following way: 1) Winter Package: The parties confirm the intention to fully implement the Winter Package. In this regard the following obligations from the Winter Package were highlighted: - Naftogaz will pre-pay and order from Gazprom sufficient quantities of gas to ensure covering all domestic consumption by Ukraine in March, - Naftogaz continues to guarantee an undisrupted transit of gas to the EU, - Gazprom will deliver up to 114 mcm per day of pre-paid and ordered gas quantities to mutually agreed delivery points. By living up to these obligations the Parties will demonstrate their reliability respectively as an important supplier of natural gas to the EU and as a key transit country for Russian gas to the EU. 2) Supply to certain areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions: The Parties acknowledged that the issue of supplies to certain areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions is highly complex in legal, technical and political terms. This issue will be further discussed. 3) Trilateral discussions of the follow-up gas package: The Parties have also stated their willingness to continue their trilateral talks in order to agree on the follow up to the gas Winter Package, as called for in the Declaration of Minsk of 12 February 2015. The European Commission invites the Parties to submit their proposals for possible agenda points for the next trilateral meeting. On this basis the European Commission will propose a draft agenda and invite the Parties to a meeting before the end of March 2015. Share this page:"

He was killed just before a demonstration against the effects of the economic crisis and the conflict in Ukraine which he was organising for 1 March. Boris Nemtsov was a strong advocate for modern, prosperous and democratic Russian Federation, open to the world. Our thoughts are with his family and friends and the Russian people.

Keynote Speech at Chatham House By the High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini,24.02.2015,24.02.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3226_en,,"  CHECK against delivery London, 24 February 2015 Many thanks for this introduction Quentin. I look forward to our discussion. You have brought us three decades of lucid analysis on the European Union in your various assignments with the Financial Times and it is wonderful to see you continue this work here at Chatham House. Chatham House is at the vanguard of new thinking on how to confront present and future challenges, so it is a pleasure to be here today. Last year Chatham House inaugurated the Queen Elizabeth II leadership academy. This means that you are not only carrying great analysis about Europe and foreign policy into the world, you are also bringing the world’s future leaders to us. When Margaret Thatcher delivered her famous Bruges speech, she quipped that, considering her views on Europe, it was quite courageous of the College of Europe to invite her. Well, given the current debate in the UK about Europe, you could say it is quite courageous of you to have me here today! But I am here today not to be daring. I am here because I believe that the UK has a central role in the European Union. In its past, its present and its future. The United Kingdom has always helped the EU to look outward, not inward. At no time is this more important than today. We count on you to continue in your role as an advocate of a European Union that is truly global in its outlook. “In an increasingly competitive world, the future belongs to those who can collaborate, innovate and co-operate together best”. These are words by Prime Minister David Cameron. And here is how the quote continues: “Our Union isn’t just some sort of deal, to be reduced to the lowest common denominator. It’s a precious thing. It’s about our history, our values, our shared identity and our joint place in the world”. I should perhaps clarify that Prime Minister Cameron was speaking to a Scottish audience, and the Union he talks about is the United Kingdom. But his words make a powerful case for a renewed British role in the EU, as well. We live in a competitive and dangerous world – and all of the world’s most serious crises are taking place right on our doorstep. I believe that there is no better way for the EU to have a global influence than to be a responsible power in our immediate neighborhood. The challenges we see in our neighboring regions illustrate the benefits of a collective EU Foreign policy on issues which affect the vital national interests of our member states. The situation at our borders has never been more urgent and never more unstable. The threats we face are complex, and need to be addressed with the broadest set of international tools available. And yes, I believe we have them. Military force is at times necessary, but never sufficient. We need to combine sanctions and incentives, quick reactions and patient negotiations, hard and soft power. Let us be frank: none of us, alone, can succeed in this complexity. This is why I believe the narrative of a clash among national interests and European interests is flawed. We hold a “joint place in the world”, and it very much depends on the unity and the effectiveness of the European Union’s international projection. It should be clear to everyone that we, the Europeans, are much better when we are together. It is a matter not of European interest but of national interest, for all. Think of Ukraine. We believed Russia could move beyond a Cold War mindset, and that we could be not just good neighbours, but partners. So far, Russia proved us wrong. Its violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty has set a very dangerous precedent. The conflict has carried an unsustainable price in human lives. Our response to the crisis mixes sanctions – both economic and political – and exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, diplomacy. We have worked through all channels, all forms and formats of dialogue that can lead to a solution: through the Trilateral Contact Group, through the efforts of mediation led by the OSCE, and of course through the talks in the Normandy Format. Some argue that this is not 'European foreign policy'. Let me say that , at the end of my five years in office, I would like to see the European Union as a key player, with one voice, ready to tackle all crises that are crucial for Europe. But we are not there yet. That's why we have all decided, in the last months, to continue to invest in the format that - since last summer- has proven to be useful in facilitating the talks between Kiev and Moscow. That's why all European Member States have unanimously decided, during the last month, to increase our political and diplomatic efforts in all possible means and formats, including the Normandy talks. I believe Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande didn’t just work for the German or French national interest, but for the interest of all of Europe. A European common foreign policy does not call for Member States to give up their own foreign policies. On the contrary, each country can reinforce our common action with its own strength and expertise. But we see Europe at its best only when all twenty-eight members push in the same direction. It is good teamwork we need. And we had it and delivered on reaching an agreement. What we need to do now is push for full implementation of that deal. Not only the European Union, but the whole international community stands behind the full implementation of all points of the Minsk agreement. The resolution that was adopted in the UN Security Council shows that we are all united on this. We welcome each step towards the fulfilment of Minsk. But the violence is not over yet. Russia and the separatist in Ukraine need to urgently implement the Minsk agreement. They must start by observing the cease fire and withdrawing their weapons. We will be steadfast in our action against further violence and stand ready to take appropriate action in case the fighting and other violations of the Minsk agreements continue. We are working, with our delegation in Kiev and all our services, to strengthen the OSCE in view of its expanded role on monitoring. You might know that today in Paris the foreign ministers of the Normandy format released a statement demanding to expand the mandate for OSCE. We are working, as always, to prepare further measures to be ready to use them if and when they will be needed. We are working to ensure that Ukraine becomes a functional state that honours the aspirations of its peoples. That is why we are supporting the country’s broad reform agenda, through macro-financial assistance; that is why we deployed the EU Advisory Mission to assist with security sector reform; and that is why we are facilitating the gas negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to ensure security of supply. And we are ready to engage in trilateral talks with Ukraine and Russia on the implementation of the DCFTA. Most of all, we are working at with the best possible tool we have: our unity. In the EU and with partners in the international community. Time and again, Moscow (and not only Moscow) has bet on divisions within our Union. I've personally feared that differences among us would have not allowed us to take unanimous decisions, even recently. But our differences have proven to be a richness. And through exhaustive dialogue we have managed to make our common European interest emerge. This is our strength. Solving the crisis and safeguarding Ukraine’s territorial integrity is not simply the interest of the Ukranian people or of the EU’s Eastern Member States. It is in the interest of all Europeans. Our common strategic interest. The same applies to Libya. A non-state on our Southern border, or worse, the rise of a subsidiary of the Islamic State – just a few hundred kilometres off our shores – would be a threat to our continent as a whole, not only to its Southern border. There is no contradiction between an eastward looking and a southward looking European Union. Only a comprehensive approach to our foreign policy can protect our values and interests in the long run. Events in North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe affect all of us. No one can expect to close their eyes. Let me say a few more words on Libya. We cannot let the country continue on its downward spiral. Human traffickers have already put at risk the lives of too many migrants in the absence of state control on Libya’s coasts or land borders. A continued tribal conflict has let the Da'esh-franchise spread thousands of miles away from the Levant. And we have already witnessed the de-stabilising effects of the conflict on the entire Sahel and the sub-Saharan region. It would be impossible to address all these concerns -migration, terrorism, regional stability – without a functioning Libyan State. This is why the European Union strongly supports the national reconciliation talks led by UN representative Bernardino Leon. A national unity government, or something close to it, is the only way forward – and the premise to any other international action, any other. In this, also, we are united. As Europeans, with our American friends, with our partners in the Mediterranean, as they have a key role to play. I hope this message gets out clear and loud to all parties in Libya: the EU and the entire international community is ready to support you by all means. But we need to see the internal dialogue work or we risk a division of the country that will make it impossible for anyone to tackle the complexity of a place like Libya. In Syria, too, the EU fully supports the UN efforts for peace – as we also mobilised more than 3 billion euros to assist Syrians in their country, as well as refugees and their host communities in neighbouring countries such as Jordan or Lebanon. The road to peace has already been too long and has not led to results so far. But we see steps in the right direction now. Staffan de Mistura’s work on a UN-brokered local ceasefires plan can pave the way towards a political solution to the crisis. It could be the first move in the direction of a Syrian-led transition, after years of bloodshed. The war in Syria has had a paramount role in the rise of the Islamic State, and we all know that: the two issues are so intertwined we cannot help addressing them in a comprehensive way, together. I would like to thank the United Kingdom for being one of the most active members of the Global Coalition to counter Daesh. I am grateful for all the important work you have done; not least for hosting the first group meeting of key coalition partners here in London last month, which I had the pleasure to attend. At that meeting we were all very clear and united as well: as we fight Daesh, we will not fall into the trap it is laying for us. We will not revive a fabricated clash of civilisations. Arab and Muslim countries are the first target of Da'esh. They have a crucial role in the coalition. Everyone should increase their efforts to prevent and halt any support – be it military or financial – to Da'esh and al-Qaeda’s associates in Syria and elsewhere. All countries in the Middle East at large can take this chance to overcome long-standing animosities. Sectarian conflicts create the perfect environment for extremism and terrorism to spread. Regional powers share an interest to stop fighting wars against each other through their proxies, and choose cooperation against their common enemy. This terrible crisis could lead to an historic opportunity: that of reshaping the current regional framework in the Middle East. The regional turmoil also reminds us of the need to restart the Middle East Peace Process as soon as we can. And I hope that will be sooner rather then later. As Da'esh challenges the frontiers and sovereignty of existing states, Israel and Palestine have the chance to mutually recognise their borders and their right to security. Peace in the “Holy Places” could lay out the most resounding message against extremism, for the region and the whole world. The protracted stalemate in the talks can only strengthen forces that oppose an agreement, in both Israeli and Palestinian communities. At the same time, all recognize that the status quo is not an option: if we don't move towards people, we will move towards ore violence. This affects not only the parties themselves, but the entire region and the wider world. We need to build a new international consensus to bring this conflict to a solution: EU, US, Russia and the UN are important pillars of this efforts. That's why I invited the Quartet Principals to meet in Munich a couple of weeks ago, where we committed to support the resumption of peace negotiations following the Israeli elections. This commitment includes calling on both parties to refrain from any actions that undermine trust. We also agreed to reach out to our Arab partners in the region more directly and more frequently. They play a key role in supporting a successful peace process, not least through the Arab Peace Initiative that provides vision for a comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Europea Union's deep political and economic partnership with Israel and our role as the foremost donor to the Palestinian Authority and UNWRA give us a key position in reinvigorating the peace talks. And it gives us a special responsibility too. I believe that the EU has to play its role in this and I will personally work on this; ensuring that the diversity and richness of our position, our history and deep ties represent an added value in our diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. Finally, Iran. A few weeks ahead of the deadline for our E3/EU +3 talks, we face an historical opportunity. As you all know, the EU is coordinating the process. A good deal is at hand – if the parties will keep cooperating, as they did so far. And if we have enough political will on all sides to agree on a good deal and 'sell' it domestically. For too long we thought of the Iranian issue as a zero-sum game. In fact, I believe it is quite the opposite: a comprehensive agreement would be hugely beneficial for both sides. The West could be reassured about its security and the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran’s economic situation would improve, and Teheran could play its role as a regional power in a positive way. A deal would open up prospects for cooperation in many areas, in our bilateral relations and in the region. Let me say that, looking at our region, we need to develop a new approach. We need to stop jumping from crisis to crisis, and to start looking at the complete picture. We need to start thinking in a strategic way. About a decade ago the EU adopted its Neighbourhood Policy. It was meant to bring stability and prosperity. And here we are, with our region in flames. There are success stories, no doubt: Tunisia, Marocco and the way in which Lebanon and Jordan are welcoming millions of refugees. But every success story has also its dark side. We have to be aware of that. We have to invest in the younger generations in a consistent way: education, employment, freedoms, rights. We have to think and to act strategically first of all in our neighborhood. That's why we a launching a review of our European Neighborhood Policy. Our European Security Strategy, on which Javier Solana didwonderful work, is now 11 years old. At the time it was conceived, no one could imagine how fast the world and our neighbourhood would change in the following years. Today everything has changed; we have changed. This is why I have launched a process of strategic reflection to guide the EU’s foreign and security policy. Amid the current global chaos, a new strategy will give us hopefull a sense of direction, an ability to make choices and to prioritise. It will also help us determine how best to mobilise all our instruments and develop partnerships that serve our common goals.  The reforms of the Lisbon Treaty gave us the tools we need. Our added value lies precisely in the unique set of instruments we can summon – from development to defence, from trade and energy to policing. But our foreign policy can sometimes be disjointed. We need to connect the dots. And we need a true sense of ownership. A common vision. A common European interest. Our identity in the world. That's why I'm starting from member states. Not only governments, but also national parliaments, think tanks, NGOs, the Foreign policy community at large. So I look forward to discussing with you here in London today, and also in the future on the new strategy to come. As we work on our new strategy, we should learn from our recent experience. After the fall of the Berlin wall, many believed the world needed some sort of “global policeman” as a security provider. After 9/11, the narrative of a “clash of civilisations” seemed to prevail. By 2015, we see that the clash runs within our civilisations, and no one can really succeed alone. In each theatre at our borders, a multitude of actors are involved. State and non-state, secular and religious. Old alliances and rising forces. In the era of cyber-attacks, traditional warfare has all but disappeared. We need to cope with fierce battles for the control of land and resources, and with propaganda wars in social media. Terror has proven to be a powerful force in our age, but so has hope. The EU should be aware of its potential. Sometimes we tend to believe that a Western or European intervention holds to key to solving any crisis. Well, I am afraid that is an illusion. We could also end up thinking that we are powerless; that  we should lock ourselves into our Fortress Europe. Let me tell you: that too would be a very naive illusion. Europe needs to be pragmatic and ambitious at once. Sometimes I say thar European Union is a superpower and some might doubt this. But we are a superpower if we combine our tools. Most of all, we need to realise that our unity is our greatest strength. We have to combine our assets and our international expertise, as we all head towards the same goal. We can work with our partners and neighbours, to support the forces that are ready to choose dialogue over confrontation. Together we can establish a more cooperative and peaceful world order. I believe that the United Kingdom is a crucial pillar in our work towards this. It has helped to create a Europe that is open to the world and not afraid to take on global challenges. I truly hope we will continue along this path. Together. Thank you. London"
Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the violation of the ceasefire in Debaltseve,18.02.2015,18.02.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/3204_en,,"The actions by the Russia-backed separatists in Debaltseve are a clear violation of the ceasefire. The separatists must stop all military activities. Russia and the separatists have to immediately and fully implement the commitments agreed to in Minsk, in line with yesterday's UN Security Council resolution, starting with the respect of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of all heavy weapons. Furthermore, the EU calls for immediate access of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to assume its monitoring and verification functions in and around Debaltseve and to any other site the Mission needs to go. Safe passage for all those who want to leave the area must also be ensured. The EU stands ready to take appropriate action in case the fighting and other negative developments in violation of the Minsk agreements continue. Bruxelles"
Remarks of the HR/VP Federica Mogherini at the informal Defence Ministers meeting in Riga,18.02.2015,18.02.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6100_en,,"I am happy to be here to chair the Defence Minister's meeting today. I will stay only for a while because afterwards I will be flying to Washington for a meeting on extremist violence and counter-terrorism, where I will have also the chance of speaking with Secretary of State Kerry and some of our Arab partners on the situation in Libya, in particular. The meeting we are having today with the Defence Ministers is particularly important, as it comes in times where our security is threatened, both at our Eastern borders and at our Southern borders. And in this respect, it is important that the European Union works more together when it comes to working on its security. It is not only about military issues, we will discuss also today the ways in which the European Union is already providing support for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Let me say that the developments overnight in Debaltseve in Ukraine were clearly a violation of the ceasefire, of the agreements that were signed. Let me stress that not only the European Union, but the whole international community, with the resolution that was adopted yesterday in the UN Security Council, stands for full implementation of all points of the Minsk agreement reached last week. It is important that first of all separatists and Russia implement this, starting from the cease-fire and the withdrawal of weapons. We will discuss and take some decisions about our common engagement in this security-challenging environment around Europe with the Defence Ministers, and I would also like to thank the Latvian Presidency for putting these issues very high on the agenda and working very hard and very well together with all our European colleagues in this respect.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the Foreign Affairs Council,09.02.2015,09.02.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/5994_en,,"The Foreign Affairs council today had on the agenda different points on urgencies and crises in our region. You also know that the crisis in Ukraine as such was not an official point of our agenda as we had our extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting ten days ago, where we had decided already to increase the level of pressure and to increase the political efforts of the European Union for getting to an implementation of the Minsk agreements. We have used these ten days, as you know, to follow up our decisions and to deliver on these decisions, in particular on adding the additional names to the list. In these last ten days there have been new political initiatives, in line with what we had decided at the Foreign Affairs Council ten days ago. Over the last days we have discussed, coordinated on these initiatives with the four actors of the Normandy format: with Germany, France, Ukraine - with President Poroshenko directly several times in these days - and with Russia; I myself had a bilateral meeting with Minister Lavrov in Munich. And I have already had the chance of expressing something that unites us and has united us all in these months and in these days: that we all believe that solution to the crisis in Ukraine can only be a political one, so we endorsed today with the Foreign Ministers all efforts done in these hours, in view of a new meeting on Wednesday to reach, finally, an implementation in full of the Minsk agreements. Today as I said the point was not on the agenda, but we are politicians, we deal with what is on the political agenda, being flexible enough to adapt our discussions to what is needed at the moment. We discussed and adopted the list of additional names of 19 individuals and nine entities that will be subject to asset freeze and visa ban, as it was decided in our last meeting ten days ago. In order to give space for our diplomatic efforts in these hours to be developed with the maximum of chances for success, we decided unanimously, united, to put the entry into force of the measures on hold until Monday 16 February, as we believe it is our duty to give this attempt that we are doing a chance. Then we will have the opportunity to assess the developments first of all on the ground, but also the developments of this initiative on Thursday with the Heads of State and Government. We have been consistent in our decisions, timely and united, and we count on continuing to do so for the future. We also discussed and decided on some other issues that are major concerns for our region, starting from Libya, where we have decided to give not only all our political but also concrete support to the small but encouraging steps of dialogue, internal dialogue, that the UN is leading. Good news is that apparently this dialogue has some chances, involving all sides. We know that the situation is - and is going to stay - fragile, but the European Union has some instruments, together with the Member States, to encourage and to protect this dialogue in its further steps to try and prevent the situation from getting out of control completely in Libya. We have to give strength to the outcome of these talks and it means in particular to look in the way we can support the confidence building measures that have been discussed and might be implemented in the future. We have also discussed and approved conclusions on Yemen. That is a situation that worries us a lot and that requires from us, today in these hours - when the UN is resuming inclusive talks - a strong political message to say that the framework provided by the GCC initiative has to remain a point of reference. And we discussed and approved a series of measures and conclusions also on other crisis areas, in particular related to Africa, on which we will discuss further in March. We adopted conclusions following up our discussion in January on counter-terrorism, related to how European Union external action can help and complement the internal measures that were discussed and decided by interior ministers. The informal Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial was held in Riga at the end of January, so we decided a set of concrete actions and initiatives to be taken immediately by the European Union together with Member States, in particular to strengthen and increase the cooperation activities with some key countries – in the Middle East, in the Arab world, in North Africa, in Sahel and in the Gulf – to work further on our diplomatic activities to try to solve the open crises, starting from the Middle East conflict. Palestine, as you know, was the centre of our work yesterday with the Quartet Principals. And to work, in particular, on prevention and on information exchange with key countries like Turkey or Saudi Arabia in our efforts to prevent and to counter terrorism from the external action side. It is an ambitious plan: you might want to look at the conclusions in detail to see all the measures that will constitute a substantial input to the discussions that the Heads of State and Government will have on this, later in the week, on Thursday. Obviously it is an ambitious plan that will need to be implemented. I hope - this will be done very coherently and quickly, and on this we will obviously need the cooperation not only of all the European Union institutions, but also of Member States, that are very much aware of the fact that this is, and has to stay, a priority of our not only internal and security action, but also of our diplomatic and Foreign policy. Tonight we are resuming, restarting, the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue, so I will have to leave to meet the two Prime Ministers for the first time. That is going to be something very important, an exercise that the European Union is facilitating, has been facilitating rather successfully in these years and that I intend to continue to facilitate in the future. So, I hope that tonight we will be able to conclude the day on a positive note. Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council on Ukraine,29.01.2015,29.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6194_en,,"CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY! We had a very fruitful meeting of the Council, that, as you know, I decided to convene after the attacks on Mariupol, on the request of some Member States, in agreement with President Tusk, with President Juncker – to not only assess the situation on the ground that is extremely worrying and negative, but also to decide on our reaction to that. And on the further steps to be taken at the European Union level. Let me first of all say that I would like to thank very much all the Ministers for their extremely responsible and constructive approach, that allowed us to have not only a very good discussion, but also to take unanimous decisions. We have, first of all – I think you will receive the conclusions adopted in a while, if you didn't already get them – agreed to support all the diplomatic efforts that are undertaken, even in these hours, and I would refer explicitly to the efforts that Ambassador Tagliavini is taking in Kyiv, with the perspective of a possible meeting in Minsk tomorrow. And we took decisions on the further steps that the European Union is going to take. You will see it in detail in the text, but we have decided to extend the restrictive measures, targeting persons and entities that were decided in March last year. We decided today to extend them until September of this year. In addition to that, we have decided to have a proposal within one week of further names of individuals and entities, to be added to this list. That decision will be taken at the next Foreign Affairs Council, on 9 February. So, in 10 days. But within one week the proposal with additional names will come to the table of the Ministers, so the decision, in this sense, has already been taken. And the third element of our decision, from our action, is to start the preparatory work. So the services, both in the EEAS and in the Commission, are starting the preparatory work on any other appropriate action that from our side can be taken in view of ensuring the implementation of the Minsk agreement. This was result by consensus of a long and good discussion among the Ministers. As I said coming in earlier today, this was also something that I discussed in these hours and days with President Poroshenko and with Minister Klimkin. And we hope that this can help putting pressure, in particular on Russia, to make positive steps and prevent negative steps that we have seen in recent days. I will stop here, the conclusions contain other sets of measures from communication to other things that you will see, but I would say – I guess – your main attention was concentrated on the sanctions, that you might have noticed, I didn't refer to coming into the meeting. But now – I cannot say that I'm happy to announce that we have taken these decisions, because I think the situation on the ground in Ukraine is not giving us any space for being happy, of anything – but one thing I can be happy of tonight, is that we kept our unity. This is, as we have always said, our strength, and we have shown that the European Union is ready to take further measures and to prepare for the measures for the weeks to come, if the situation not only doesn't improve, but gets worse, as was the case in the last days.

Speech of the HR/VP Federica Mogherini at the CELAC Summit,28.01.2015,28.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6195_en,,"CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY!  CELAC Summit- Heads of Government meeting – Wednesday 28 January 2015  Sr. Presidente de la Republica de Costa Rica, Sres Presidentes y Cancilleres, Excelencias, distinguidos delegados  de los paises membros de la CELAC, senoras y senores, es para mi un honor dirigere a esta Cumbre, en nombre de la Union Europea, en un ano particularmente importante para las relaciones entre la Union y America Latina y el Caribe. Es tambien un placer tener la opotunitad de encontrarme con todos ustedes, de muchos de lo cuales me considero amiga, cuando apenas vengo de asumir mis nuevas responsabilidades. Cuenten ustedes con mi amistad personal, mi dedicacion y compromiso para que nuestra cooperacio sea cada dia mas fuerte. Most of all, I want to thank you because in San Jose have the opportunity to assure Latin America, at the beginning of my mandate, on the renewed impetus that as EU we want to give to our relations. Strengthening our relation is a strategic priority. In a world where development and democracy are so threatened, we have to work on new perspectives for a space of peace and dialogue. Already for more than 15 years, the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean have maintained a strategic bi-regional partnership. But the structured engagement of the EU in the region certainly predates the launching of this partnership in Rio in 1999. That engagement actually began right here, in Central America, in the 1980s. The San José dialogue of 1984 which lasted several years became a milestone in the EU's support to peace processes in the region. This reinforced other initiatives such as the Contadora group and the subsequent efforts led by President Oscar Arias, all of which greatly contributed to bringing peace to Central America. However, it is not the simple fact of being the longest standing international partner of the region that I want to highlight today. When addressing the wide range of current international affairs, and the pressing challenges that affect us all, from climate change to non-proliferation or countering terrorism, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean appear as the two most like-minded regions in the world. This is the combination of our shared history, cultural affinity and strong social contacts, but also of our shared principles and values, and strong belief in effective multilateralism. However, we cannot take these for granted,  our shared objective must be to translate our common values and principles into an example to bring about positive change around the world. While it is not possible to 'export' values, it is our duty, for all of us, to be consistent and coherent, so that we can truly be an example of freedom and democracy, Throughout the decades, our priorities have resembled and converged in the past and we need to make sure they will keep converging in the future. This is why I am pleased to note that one of the key themes of this Summit, the fight against poverty and the use of public funds with a particular attention to transparency, is also at the core of the EU's external action. We support these concepts in all our development cooperation initiatives around the world, convinced that development efforts can only take root within a framework of accountability and responsible action by public authorities towards their citizens. Moreover, we are all engaged in the definition of the post 2015 development agenda on the basis of sustainable development goals and the EU strongly believes that together with CELAC partners we can influence significantly the outcome of this process. A holistic framework based on poverty eradication, reduction and prevention of inequalities everywhere in the world, environmental and socio-economic sustainability and the principles of rule of law offers the best chance to promote the future we want. Climate change is the other global issue in which our good cooperation is essential. The EU is pleased with the results of COP 20 in Lima and is very grateful to Peru for the excellent preparation and management of the conference. Now, we have to concentrate our joint efforts towards a global legally binding agreement at COP 21 in Paris. At the EU we also follow with great interest what constitutes the second key theme of this Summit, the future evolution of CELAC. Throughout these years, the EU has been consistently supporting the regions’ integration process and upon its establishment in 2011, CELAC became our interlocutor within the bi-regional relationship. Taking into account the richness of our dialogues in many fields and the dense network of agreements at all levels, with most of your countries, I confidently believe that the EU is CELAC's most structured international partner. CELAC will always find the support of the EU. We see open regionalism as a stepping stone to a more effective global multilateralism. We see our partnership as one of equals, based on mutual respect, but we wish to have stronger relations with you in order to unlock the potential that our joint efforts can still bring - within our regions but also globally. The mutual benefits of our partnership are clearly manifested in bi-regional trade and investment. Over time, the EU has consolidated its position as the first foreign investor in the region, accounting for one third of the overall investment in the CELAC area. Figures speak for themselves: EU investments in Latin America and the Caribbean are greater than those we have in Russia, India and China combined.  Most important, we believe that this economic activity has brought along important benefits to the region, and act as vehicle to further develop concepts such as corporate social responsibility, or environmental sustainability. However, the benefit is also reciprocal  and we see with great enthusiasm the rise in recent years of investments from CELAC countries in the EU. We encourage very much these two way flows. Our reciprocal trade doubled in the last decade and the EU is CELAC's second trade partner. Certainly, the economic crisis hitting Europe caused the reduction of the EU imports from the CELAC region, but we are keen to increase trade by both developing the network of trade agreements and conducting concrete actions to support the business. There are many fields in which we can strengthen our cooperation: small and medium sized enterprises, security, the fight against poverty and social inequality. Alongside our strong political and economic relations, we have heard the demands for cooperation in areas such as technical innovation, education, economic diversification and environmental sustainability. We are already doing much together in these areas, but the EU is open to further develop joint cooperation. Moreover, as regards citizen security, the EU stands ready to work with our willing partners in Central America, where we once started, but also in the Caribbean and beyond. These are just some examples of fields in which we can cooperate more. Ladies and Gentlemen, Together, the EU and CELAC represent 61 States, about 1/3 of United Nations members. But we are much more than just the sum of our parts. The positive example of our partnership is very much needed in an ever-complicated world, in which some of the key principles of the international order are at stake. I do believe that the EU and Latin America and the Caribbean have the opportunity to continue deepening a constructive relationship based on common values and principles and a strong belief in effective multilateralism, of which we are part, and to positively influence the rest of the world by doing so. An important milestone in the calendar of both regions this year will be the next EU-CELAC Summit in Brussels, to which you are all invited. Two years after the Santiago Summit, there will be a lot to take stock of, but most important, it will be an opportunity to lay down the parameters of our bi-regional relations for the coming years and shaping our common future, in which we must ensure prosperous and sustainable societies to our citizens. In view of that, the EU relies a lot on the excellent cooperation with CELAC pro-tempore presidencies - currently Costa Rica whom we would like to thank and soon Ecuthank with whom We'll be happy to work - and its individual members to prepare our joint Summit and make a success of it. We attach high importance to the meeting and to the documents we will adopt, but, above all, we attach high importance to an open dialogue with you and to developing joint visions and actions on what I want to turn into a Partnership for the Next Generation. This Summit come in a time of change for the Region, with new perspectives in the Cuba-US relations, and for Europe. A new leadership has just started its mandate, and my presence here, in my first 100 days in office, is a concrete sign of how much we value our partnership and how much we are willing to take it to a further stage. As President Solis told me yesterday, the relations between EU and CELAC can't be only on trade and economy. We have to deepen our political dialogue, starting from a common vision and common roots. We can help the world to move from confrontation to cooperation and respect. I'll be happy to work together on this perspective in the coming years. Bruxelles"
Quartet Envoys' Press Statement,26.01.2015,26.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2684_en,,"The Middle East Quartet Envoys (US, Russia, UN and EU) met on 26 th January in Brussels. EU High Representative Federica Mogherini attended the start of the meeting. The envoys shared assessments of the political outlook for the region and prospects for reviving the Middle East Peace Process. They explored the role that the Quartet could play in supporting the resumption of meaningful negotiations with the aim of achieving a comprehensive peace agreement based on a two-state solution. They noted in this regard the importance of engaging closely with their Arab partners.  They agreed on the importance of convening a meeting of the Quartet Principals as soon as possible. They also underscored the urgency of improving the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and agreed that every effort should be made to encourage the fulfilment of pledges of assistance made at the Cairo Conference on the reconstruction of Gaza in October last year.

Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the attack on Mariupol,24.01.2015,24.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2670_en,,"Residential areas of the city of Mariupol have been fired upon today from separatist held territory, which has cost the lives of at least fifteen civilians, wounding many others and terrorising the innocent population. This comes after a series of indiscriminate attacks in the Donbas in the past few days, accompanied by the announcements of further offensives by Russia-backed separatists, who bluntly refuse to observe the cease fire. This further escalation of the open armed conflict has tragic consequences for a population greatly suffering already for far too long. It would inevitably lead to a further grave deterioration of relations between the EU and Russia. I call therefore openly upon Russia to use its considerable influence over separatist leaders and to stop any form of military, political or financial support. This would prevent disastrous consequences for all. Those responsible for the escalation must stop their hostile actions and live up to their commitments. Bruxelles"
Statement by the Spokesperson on the latest developments regarding the situation in Eastern Ukraine,23.01.2015,23.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2662_en,,"Time is running out in Eastern Ukraine where the escalation of fighting has caused far too many civilian as well as military casualties. Yesterday at least eight civilians were killed at a bus stop in Donetsk. Those responsible for the recent escalation must now show that they are serious about their commitment to a political settlement and do their utmost to halt the spiral of violence, including by withdrawing heavy weapons without delay and by respecting the line of contact as foreseen in the Minsk Memorandum. We call notably on Russia to fully assume its responsibility. Public statements distorting the reality on the ground, inciting to hatred and further violence will not lead to the badly needed de-escalation. International humanitarian law, including as regards the treatment of prisoners, must be respected. The public parading of prisoners in Donetsk yesterday clearly violated such standards. The EU stands fully behind the efforts towards a political solution of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, including the meeting earlier this week of the Ministers of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in Berlin. We expect the Trilateral Contact Group to convene as soon as possible, with participation of all signatories of the Minsk agreements. The cessation of hostilities should be the first step towards full and swift implementation of the Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014 as the basis for a sustainable political solution respecting Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.

"Remarks by Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the European Union and Vice-President of the European Commission, at the Brookings Institute",20.01.2015,20.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6180_en,,"Thank you very much for the memories.  For the warm welcome, and also for the joint invitation.  It's a pleasure to be back here in Brookings.  Actually, I was in, I think, in another room next door less than a year ago.  It's a pleasure to meet again, friends.  Not only at Brookings.  I have to say, my student, a fellow in 2007, was one of the best and most important experiences of my life, and I would say that shows that the fellowship works. But coming here, I realized that the first time I travelled to America, I was 28.  And that was just after 9/11.  And all Europeans felt very strong sense of solidarity at that time.  All Americans in our hearts, and with our minds.  And I remember very well that during my visit, that was a private trip, I was very much impressed by the sense of pride and unity of the American people in those days after the attacks.  And US flags were everywhere, and rightly so. 14 years later, I have seen the same sense of pride and unity in the streets of Paris.  With thousands, millions, actually, of citizens.  French European citizens show the strongest possible reaction to a terrorist attack that many Europeans, many French, perceived as our own 9/11.  Obviously, we have had other attacks on European Union soil.  In Madrid, in London, and now in Paris.  But the numbers of victims are usually not comparable, but the symbol is the same.  As America was attacked, targeting the symbols of power and integration, the World Trade Center, Europe was attacked targeting the symptoms of its freedoms and rights.  Journalists, freedom of speech, media freedom, the police, the right to live in security.  Jewish people, freedom of religion and rights of minorities.  And if you try and test a little bit your French, liberté, égailté, securité.  Words have disappeared from the narrative, and I think this is a message we should all reflect upon at this time. In 2001, America reacted with pride and unity around its flag.  Today, we are reacting with pride and unity around a renewed sense of European identity.  Not something to be given for granted, if you look at the political trends of the years in Europe.  Still, we have the duty to ask ourselves why after 14 years we are still there under attack, and draw on lessons from the past.  That's why in Paris we're marching together, not only with European leaders but also I would say with leaders from Italy, the Gulf, Africa.  That's why even on the day of the march in Paris, the 11th, we felt the need to look at the atrocities that Boko Haram was perpetrating to thousands of citizens in Nigeria. And that is why just yesterday in Brussels, together with all foreign ministers of the European Union, we met with the Secretary-General.  That's because we know this is not a fight between the West and Islam.  We know that the first victims of terror -- and because we know that that's what we need in order to face truly and effectively the terrorist threat in Europe and elsewhere in the world -- is an alliance, a partnership of civilization.  It's not easy, and it will not be easy at all, in Europe and outside Europe, but nothing in the world we're living in is easy, and everything is complex. We live in an age of unprecedented complexity.  The world is becoming at once more interconnected, more conflictual and more concentric.  It's a world in which power is infused in overlapping senses.  It's a complex world that requires a capacity to read, understand, and tackle it if we want to play a role.  I'm afraid the European Union has a unique role in this, managing complexity that surrounds us.  Seen from the outside, and I can say even from the inside, the European Union seems very complex itself.  These are institutions, the way we make decisions, our many cultural traditions and languages.  We are different.  We are complex.  And believe me, it is a real challenge and it can be a real nightmare.  And our duty is to make sure that we make European Union work in a more rational, quick, and also simple way. But that's also added value.  Over the years, we have learned to benefit from our different perspectives and we have built consensus around them.  Our differences don't make it impossible for us to work together and act united.  In the new world that we see emerging, I will not say new world order, the new world emerging, forging consensus and building partnership is essential.  It's a world where the West still has a significant power, but the power is not longer -- it can only been exercised in cooperation with others.  I'm convinced a partnership could be the bedrock of this if we learn our lesson and look ahead to the future of our role in the world.  Our bonds cannot rely only on our common past.  Now it's a moment to shape our common future if we want to shape a world order based on cooperation and respect instead of competition, and already in the events of the first weeks of this year shows us how urgent it is to address the challenges we face. From the conflict in Ukraine to Iraq and Syria, to the attacks in Paris to the carnage spread by Boko Haram, we need the trans-Atlantic partnership more than ever.  We need cooperation in a world that is more interconnected, than ever.  Human mobility and technology, it is expected to near 2 billion by 2016.  Migration is accelerating as a result of conflict, climate change, and economic deprivation.  Last year, 200,000 people migrants, mostly from Syria and the Horn of Africa, reached Europe through the central Mediterranean route, and beyond refugees and migrants, Europe like the United States and eventually China, will need to attract high skills workers to its aging continents if it wants to sustain current leading standards. Interconnection has its dark sides, too.  Think about terrorist networks and foreign fighters.  Think of the spread of global epidemics, ebola being the largest manifestation.  Technology adds to this for good and for bad.  Nowhere is this clearer than in the field of communications where social media provided an indispensable vehicle for the mass mobilisations of the Arab Spring.  And I would still refer to 'Arab Spring'- seasons sometimes take a longer time.  And for the recruitment and outreach of a plethora of terrorist groups.  Likewise, our world is becoming more conflictual and we see it every day.  Depleting natural resources coupled with a growing population with a large number of people in largely economically deprived areas sets the scene for greater competition in the world.  Food security and water remain a critical challenge in large parts of Africa and in the Middle East with the food price hike in 2011 being recognized as one of the triggers for the upheaval across the region. Technology couples with climate change creating new opportunities in the Arctic, which if not managed well, risks triggering conflict.  Security is another element of potential conflict.  While new discoveries and revolutions present an undeniable opportunity, breeding these opportunities will require upgraded cooperation in Europe and between Europe and its partners starting with the United States, as well as new investments in infrastructure and technology and redoubled efforts at addressing climate change.  Technological advancement has created the potential for greater conflict.  Think about cyberspace, which has become the new frontier of 21 st century warfare. Finally, this is not the end of the speech, I'm sorry about that, our world is becoming increasingly concentric.  New powers are on the rise.  First and foremost, China.  The proliferation of emerging economy acronyms shows partnership.  The US and Europe alone no longer set the agenda in global affairs.  I guess we understood that by now, and yet we would not argue that power is shifting from the West to the rest.  I think this is simplistic.  It's inaccurate.  It is inaccurate because there are no alternative alliances, notwithstanding all the talks about that.  And it is inaccurate because the West is not in decline, as it is evident here on this side of the Atlantic looking at the US's impressive economic performance in the past years and the resilience of the European soldiers.  It's going through difficult times but still is the most successful regional integration experience.  And it is inaccurate because power is defusing behind structures, lying in government, regional, and international organizations, companies, societies, simple citizens.  The new world order we might see emerging is not, cannot be a zero sum game where increased influence for some necessarily means decreased influence for others.  It is a world where influence is, can be, should be shared.  This and the fact that the challenges we face are joint challenges sometimes global challenges, makes cooperation even more crucial. This brings me to our relationship.  It is a relationship that some maybe believe has passed the stage.  It is because of diverging demographics with an increasing Hispanic America and aging Middle Eastern Europe.  Be it because of partly diverging security terms with Europe focused on our neighborhood and US on the Asia Pacific, yet, the global challenges and opportunities we face are so complex, so difficult, that only a renewed trans-Atlantic partnership can face up to them.  We have a long history that makes it natural for us, for my generation in particular, but also for the previous one, to be friends, to be partners.  We share values, and that is the basis of our common cultural identity.  That is strong and no one can take that away from us.  That's in our DNA. Now, the two pillars of the renewed trans-Atlantic bond that I see are security and economy.  Supply and demand side forces the trans-Atlantic security cooperation, and we're slowly but surely expanding the new US cooperational security and defense.  On the supply side, US has made it clear that it expects its European partners to shoulder more of the security responsibility in our own neighbourhood, and no longer feels ill at ease with the development of European defense capabilities.  On the contrary, at the same time, the European Union is developing into a security provider with our 30 missions and operations to date focused mainly on institutional reforms and capacity building.  On the demand side, when NATO retains the responsibility for security, the European Union is taking on the lead in helping its members, neighbors, and partners and systems of good governance that will reduce corruption, and thereby have an ability to extend the civilization.  That requires time, but I think it's a good investment.  Risks have not only put a premium on the NATO cooperation, let me say that I was particularly proud and happy that in the very first day of my mandate, I was meeting with the NATO Secretary-General, we're starting the mandate together, and we're starting a very strong and close cooperation.  We have common challenges there, and even if the 28 members aren't overlapping completely, they're overlapping significantly. Beyond security, TTIP is the next frontier.  It's a win-win project aimed at creating more business opportunities, reducing costs, eliminating administrative burden, and in so doing, stimulating growth and creating jobs.  But it is much more than a free trade area.  It's going to create the largest free trade area in the world.  And by doing so, I think it will inject momentum into the development of global rules in areas which multilateral negotiations have stalled.  It can become a benchmark for the future trade agenda.  Let me be clear.  European Union is committed to an ambitious, mutually beneficial TTIP for the benefit of business and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.  And I think we have to use the opportunity ahead of us. I know I've been already far too long, and I'm sure it's typically European, so let me conclude by reviewing what this is in our view.  Cooperation begins along the arc of instability surrounding the European Union.  If you see the world map, the most, the high difficult places around the world are all around European Union.  Maybe we should ask ourselves a question.  On the European continent, the European Union and US are on the same line when it comes to the European perspective and reform priorities in the West and in turkey as well as in the Eastern partners, notably Georgia and Moldova. Of course, Ukraine is where cooperation is more urgent and intense as we struggle to see the full implementation of the agreement.  And we together pressure Russia through our sanctions policy.  With Russia we share the approach based on sanctions in view of Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea, and also in view of its role on the conflict in the East of Ukraine, while keeping the door open for dialogue, both on the solution of the conflict in Ukraine and on the common global challenges we face.  Together, we actively support Ukraine's reform efforts aimed at eradicating corruption, pursuing constitutional, judicial, electoral, energy sector reform, and I could go on. In the Mediterranean, multiple and interconnected places from Libya to the Sahel and Iraq, through Israel, Palestine, and Iran, all call for cooperation.  Neither the US nor Europe can settle this crisis alone.  And I think we both understand it very well.  Trans-Atlantic cooperation is imperative as is engagement with all relative regional and international powers that have an influence in the region.  We know that very well.  On some issues such as Iran, while the finer outcome remains uncertain, the trans-Atlantic format of the nuclear talks has already proved its strength, and we are jointly working towards a robust long-term solution that will guarantee the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.  While nuclear negotiations are entirely separate from other regional issues, I believe joint trans-Atlantic strategic thinking and action is crucial on Iran's regional role. On the Middle East peace process, the protracted deadlock should trigger collective, and first of all transatlantic, rethinking of our overall approach.  The increased predominance of regional actors and recent steps at UN security council on a resolution, and the Palestinian steps towards the ICC, all point towards a quite messy, if you allow me a little diplomatic word, conflict, and I think we cannot afford really the process or rather the lack of process with no framework, with no international framework.  In light of this, we should work on a possibly relaunched Quartet, which could act as a forum to establish a renewed consensus.  A sort of laboratory that could find concessions through the UN and make process not only restart but also bring some results. Beyond the European neighborhoods, let me focus on three final priorities for our cooperation.  First, trans-Atlantic cooperation on intelligence is essential.  It's crucial for security on both sides of the Atlantic, and the attacks in Paris I think are a tragic reminder of the links between external and internal security.  We need to share information more.  At the same time, our population on both sides of the Atlantic demand that public liberties and privacy are not unduly affected.  Indeed, an organic element of our own response to terrorists and violence must be that of living up to our values of freedom and respect of our citizens and others. Second, energy security.  We had last December an EU-US energy council that was an excellent opportunity to take stock of how far we have come and where we can move forward together.  And I think we should strengthen trans-Atlantic energy trade by removing buyers to our trades.  This would open new export markets for the US, for the producers, and help the European Union face the pressures from other suppliers.  On LNG export restrictions, while lifting would not immediately address European dependence on Russian gas, it would send the right signals to global markets and it would encourage further investment upstream and downstream.  By including existing chapter on energy and raw materials, we would reduce barriers to trade investments in the energy sector and rules on transfer on renewables. Third and last point, energy should bring us to climate policy.  It is essential that European Union and the US partner in order to deliver an effective deal in Paris later this year.  Trans-Atlantic positions have now aligned as they have never, never done before in history.  Our challenge is that of transforming this shared sense of purpose into a joint EU/US leadership to take forward a solution that can fit the challenge.  There is also mutual EU/US responsibility on the agenda this year, ending extreme poverty and achieving sustainment development alongside averting dangerous climate change and challenges of my generation.  EU and US leadership is driving an agreement in the UN general assembly for an ambitious set of targets for the framework, would also send a very strong sign in support of effective multilateralism, and that would also be a sign that we have learned some of our lessons when it comes to the coherence of our choices and our policy. To conclude, at a time of unprecedented uncertainty, our collective joint responsibility is that of trying to take this as an opportunity to finally lead the endless transition that my generation has been living, towards a real new global order.  At such complex times, I understand it might seem naive even to say so, yet the alternative is not sustainable for all.  And the only way in which we can realistically think to achieve this is by working together.  Trans-Atlantic partnership has already broken a world record.  The longest lasting and strongest partnership in history.  Our challenge is that of collectively together breaking a new record, insuring that the shift from the actual global disorder to a new global order based on cooperation and partnership will be not only successful but also a peaceful one.  Thank you very much.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival at Foreign Affairs Council,19.01.2015,19.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6172_en,,"CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY Today the Council will have many different heavy issues on the table. We'll start with a discussion on how to counter terrorism not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world such as in the Mediterranean region and Africa. I'm just having now, before we start, a meeting with the Secretary General of the Arab League, Mr El Araby, as the threat is not only the one we faced in Paris but also spreading in many other parts of the world, starting with Muslim countries. We need to strengthen our way of cooperating together, first of all with Arab countries but also internally. Interior Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers will have discussion about that and we need to share information more, we need to cooperate more also among Member States on the security level and we'll discuss that with Commissioner Avramopoulos. I've always said it is not an issue between Europe or the West and Islam. Terrorism and terrorist attacks are targeting most of all Muslims in the world so we need an alliance, we need a dialogue there to face the issue together. We also need to take full responsibility for what we do and what we say and I think that respect is also one of the main core values of the European Union. Drawing the line between the freedom of expression and respect has always been one of the main philosophical dilemmas, but I think we need to look at that very carefully these days as we see what is happening in many parts of the world. What we need to do is face terrorism while respecting Islam. Then we'll have a discussion on Russia. The point of the discussion is not our support to Ukraine - that stays strong and firm; it is not a decision on sanctions - don't expect anything like that today. It's a follow-up of the discussion we had in November already in the Foreign Affairs Council and in December with the Heads of States and Governments. We will be preparing the decisions for the months to come, but any decisions on sanctions - as we agreed several times among Ministers but also with President Tusk and President Juncker - will only be based on improvements on the ground, on implementation of the Minsk agreement. And in these days obviously the coming back of violence in the East of Ukraine is definitely not good news. What we will discuss today is the ways in which the European Union's tools and the instruments we have, apart from sanctions, can be used in a more coordinated way and in a more effective way. We'll also have a discussion on Libya following the talks in Geneva. We'll discuss that more in details with Ministers and see how the European Union can further support the positive news that are coming from there. We'll also have a discussion on climate change, with the climate change Action Plan in view of the decisions to be taken later this year in Paris in December. Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the press conference after the Foreign Affairs Council,19.01.2015,19.01.2015,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6177_en,,"http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I097769 As you know, we started our work with the point on terrorism, reacting not only to what happened in Paris earlier this month but also to a common threat that is there not only for Europeans but also countries and people in the Arab world, in Africa, in Asia. I have to say that, probably for the first time, there was a real deep awareness of the need to work together and – I was surprised to know for the first time – the Foreign Affairs Council had a discussion with our EU Counter terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove. I think this was not only a good exchange of views but also discussions on some decisions to take that is obviously only the first step.  We will reconvene in the format of Home Affairs ministers later in the month and then the next Foreign Affairs Council in just three weeks, then we will make full recommendations to the informal meeting of Heads of State of Government on 12 February. When it comes to decisions we have taken, first of all on the security level - which is obviously, clearly a dimension for the Interior Ministers and for Commissionaire Avramopoulos - we took the decision within the Foreign Affairs Council to coordinate in a much more active way than it has been the case so far. First of all, with an input to share intelligence information not only within the European Union but also with other countries around us starting from the Mediterranean and the Arab world, Turkey, Egypt, Gulf countries, North Africa but also looking to Africa and Asia. The second point on the security level is that we have re-invited the European Parliament to work on the Passengers name record, the PNR. This is not the competence of the Foreign Affairs ministers, but still they are politicians and members of the national cabinets; so our Council gave a strong call for moves in that direction, as well as the need to increase our work preventing financing of terrorist networks. A joint meeting of experts organised by EU and US together with Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and the UN agencies is going to take place in Brussels on counter-financing of terrorist organisations, in particular Da'esh. The second level of decisions we have taken is to raise our level of cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally with Arab and Mediterranean countries starting with the League of Arab States. You know I have had a meeting today with the Secretary General, we signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen our cooperation to make sure that it is carried out on a more structured and regular basis on a series of issues. First on counter-terrorism, we are looking at specific projects to launch with specific countries to increase the level of cooperation on counter-terrorism; I would name Egypt, Yemen, Algeria, Gulf countries. And not only on the level of League of Arab states, let me also mention that we need to work more and more on Africa. Today, I released a statement on Boko Haram on behalf of the 28, and that is to me, to us, a very important part of our counter-terrorist activity because we need to tackle the narrative saying that we have a double standard, that we only care about victims in Europe. This is not correct. We know very well that the first victims of terrorism and terrorist acts are Muslims and Arab countries.  So as I said this morning we need to work on developing a dialogue, an alliance of civilisation and avoid any kind of perception of a clash. Second, we also have decided to work together, in particular with Arab countries and the League of Arab states, on open conflicts and open crisis. Because it has two elements in it that touch on the capacity of terrorist activities and organisations on one side - the creation of failed states or areas without any kind of control for state authorities that makes it easier for terrorist networks to work, to have access to resources; this is something we have to prevent. Additionally, open crisis and conflicts in the area feed in a very strong way the narrative that may attract more and more young people to terrorist organisations and actions. And third, we have decided to work on the cultural message. As I said – and I know the secretary General of the Arab league has also said it -  what we need is an alliance, a dialogue, work together because we are all facing the same threat. This dialogue should not only take part between the  European Union and Arab Countries but also inside the European Union with the Muslim communities. And then last but not least at all, we need to work together more and more - and the European union has all the instrument to do so - on the root causes of some of these phenomena - and in particular the economic and social situation of the younger generation in many of these countries. Obviously all these measures will require further work and preparation - when I say we are going to launch projects on counterterrorism together with some other countries, we will need to work in the coming weeks to identify more precisely which projects and which instruments. When it comes to concrete, immediate actions that I can personally take,  there are two things that I have agreed to the Ministers:  on one side, to have security attachés in the European Union Delegations in relevant countries. This means regular contact among professionals on our side and on the country that is hosting the delegation's side to develop cooperation on security issues and counterterrorist issue. On the other side, the second thing that I want to do is to improve our communication with Arabic speaking populations, be it in the European Union and with the larger Arab communities in the World. I think we need to improve our capacity to speak Arabic, read Arabic, explain to the Arabic-speaking population our policies and also to listen to the messages that are coming from the Arab world. And I think this is a basic communication strategy that we need to implement from the very beginning. Another point that was raised, and we will work on that in the coming weeks, is to have an exchange of best practices that are realised at national level – to see how some of those can be implemented at the European Union level.  On this particular issue of counterterrorism there are some things that are working well  in Members States that we could share much more at European level. We then had a long discussion on our relations with Russia. As you might remember, we had a discussion on that already in November that was focused on Ukraine and at that time ministers agreed on the need to have more to start a strategic discussion on some open questions in EU-Russia relations. This was also something that was indicated as useful by the European Council in December which, as you might remember, discussed the issue of Russia. And to follow that up, and also to start preparing the European Council in March – that would need decisions on the first set of sanctions expiring – I had agreed, together with President Tusk, with President Juncker and with the Latvian Presidency, to submit an issues paper for Ministers to reflect. Some of you had the paper before the Ministers, but this is another story, and today we had a long, very in-depth and useful discussion about many of those questions that are open. Let me start by saying that starting a strategic debate does not mean and has not meant changing the course of our relations with Russia. We stay the course, as it is stated in the issue paper for the Ministers. And we are united on this. Those who were expecting divisions, major divisions today on Russia, I think will be a little bit disappointed, because we are united. We were united and we are still united on this. Our relations with Russia can only change if and when – I hope when, but at the moment it's if – commitments that were taken in Minsk are implemented. And let me say that the latest developments on the ground are definitely not encouraging, rather the contrary. I know that the value of our position is unity, so the early discussion in the beginning of the year was also meant to prepare an ownership that can allow sustaining the unity among ourselves on different things. Our support to Ukraine, and not only to Ukraine, but also to all our Eastern Partners, is there and it is not going to change. Our pressure on Russia, with the sanctions policy, where as I have said several times: any decision will be based on, first of all, the non-recognition policy of the annexation of Crimea and on the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, on the situation on the ground. And again today, the situation on the ground is definitely much worse than in the last weeks. The discussion today was rather on what we add, not on what we change. This, what I mentioned, is not changing and is most probably not going to change. What we can add – and what we agreed that would be useful to add on our side – is on one side more diplomatic efforts, in any format, to contribute to solving the crisis. And on the second level, a political dialogue on global and regional issues, being it Syria or the Iranian talks on nuclear, or the Middle East Peace Process or again some of the regional crises we have – be it in Afghanistan or in Libya – and major global challenges like climate change and counter terrorism where we do have an interest in having a political dialogue on global and regional issues with Russia. And to explore further, at technical level, some options for sectorial dialogues on, in particular, a couple of fields: Energy – as you know, this is not new – this has been a dialogue that has been going on all through the crisis, in particular in the last months and is going to continue. And to explore elements for people-to-people contacts that could be useful to engage not so much the Russian authorities but the Russian population with the European Union. We also have decided to have the European Union working on a strategic communication to promote correct, impartial and independent information in the region. So, as you see, and as you have heard - from I guess all the Ministers, I have not checked their declarations coming out - the consensus in the room was definitely higher than in many other occasions in the past. There is no normalisation; there is no back to business as usual in any way. There is a reflection on how to use in the best possible way our tools, our role, in addition to the policies that we have been following in the past. And we will definitely come back to this in the coming Foreign Affairs Council meetings before the March European Council. As you know, we have another Foreign Affairs Council in three weeks and then again in March. Let me also touch upon two issues very quickly that were also on the agenda. We endorsed a Climate Change Action Plan that will help us reaching a good result in Paris at the conference in December. And the European Union is not only ready, but also willing to take the lead on this. And the second, we had a short but important update on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where you might remember we discussed and decided in December to follow a way of a written commitment from the Bosnian Presidency and then signed by the political leaders and voted by the Parliament to re-open the way. And we assessed the fact that the work done by the Presidency and shared with the political leaders in these very same hours is going definitely in the right direction, so that helps to conclude on a rather positive note, which is something that from time to time in these times you need.

With this latest decision the number of Russian NGOs labelled as ""foreign agents"" has increased to a total of twenty-four.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon arrival to the European Council,18.12.2014,18.12.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6748_en,,"Brussels, 18 December 2014 I just came back yesterday night from Kyiv. It will be a good opportunity today to brief the European Council. We will discuss Ukraine, first of all the need to support the reform agenda in Ukraine. I think that it's time for the European Union to concentrate on making Ukraine a success and this is something that will require work both in Kyiv and in Brussels. And also as President Tusk has said, I think a few minutes ago coming in, the need for us to develop a sound, responsible strategy with Russia. We will start tonight and I'm ready to follow that up, looking at how the conversation will develop tonight, and follow that up in January with the Foreign Ministers. I think that at the moment it is time for all sides, first of all from Russia, to implement the Minsk agreement, in all its points. First we have to see results, concrete results on the ground. And I hope that in the coming days we might see some positive developments in this sense. The Minsk agreement contains very precise objectives and also some reference to the time framework and I would expect this time framework to be respected in a few days. I want to make clear one thing: the situation of Russia, the fact that Russia is in a difficult situation from a financial point of view, is not good news. It is not good news first of all for the Russian citizens and this is what everybody including or starting from the Russian leadership should take care about. But also it is not good news for Ukraine, also it is not good for Europe or for the rest of the world. I normally do not tend to think that what is negative for someone can be positive for someone else, but it is true that President Putin and the Russian leadership should reflect seriously about the need for introducing radical change in the attitude toward the rest of the world and to switch to a cooperative mode. I think this would be very much needed, I would say as much as it is needed a cooperation on the various different crisis that we have. The world has never been as dangerous and unstable as it is now and it would be good news if we managed to build a constructive relationship to deal with some of these crises, at least and obviously starting from Ukraine.

Statement by the Spokesperson on recent human rights developments in Chechnya,17.12.2014,17.12.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/2225_en,,"The surge of tensions in Chechnya, in particular relating to the recent terrorist attacks in Grozny, calls for a measured response. We extend our condolences to the families of the victims. Those responsible for serious crimes in Chechnya, whether acts of terrorism or human rights violations, should be brought to justice. In spite of the grief, calls from President Kadyrov for the collective punishment of families of armed militants will only exacerbate tensions. The crackdown on Human Rights activists in Chechnya, threats against Igor Kalyapin and the recent attacks against the Joint Mobile Group whose offices were set on fire, should stop. As a member of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the EU expects Russia to stand by its international commitments, and ensure the safety of human rights defenders, in particular those who continue to work in the Northern Caucasus.

Remarks by High Representative on the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 December 2014,15.12.2014,15.12.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6760_en,,"The main issue of today's Foreign Affairs Council was Syria.  We started by preparing our discussion yesterday with an extremely good meeting with the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura. I said this morning that you would have more details about the concrete support that the European Union can give to his efforts. First of all you might have seen already the conclusions we adopted through a very a smooth process, as they were already agreed before entering the meeting. This gave some space for a real in-depth political debate amongst all the ministers. The general sense of our discussion and our decision was first of all to not only give full and strong support to Staffan de Mistura, but also concrete support to his efforts, knowing that these efforts to achieve a strategic de-escalation of violence are and can be a basis for a broader political process. We refer to it in the conclusions in this way, I quote, 'a lasting solution to the conflict can only be a Syrian-led political process leading to transition'. This means also that we know very well that there is an urgency to work on the freeze, in particular the freeze of hostility in Aleppo. I know that very well, notably as I visited the border between Syria and Turkey just one week ago.. Aleppo is not only a city with a large population, it is also a city that represents an important symbol in the region and in the country. If we manage to work on the freeze together with Staffan de Mistura, supporting his efforts, it could be also one possible way of showing that reduction of violence is possible in Syria. This could even lead to a political process in the country. The concrete elements of the EU support to the UN Special Envoy efforts can be on two levels. On one side, we have agreed to have a focused diplomatic effort in the region. This means, as mentioned in the conclusions, that the EU is ready to engage with all regional and international actors with influence over the Syrian parties. This sentence was not there in previous decisions of the Council,. This means explicitly that we will work with all the actors that have a say, that have a role, that can be part of the solution to the Syrian crisis, namely big Gulf countries, starting from Saudi Arabia but also Iran and Russia. We have decided that we will develop our diplomatic initiative towards these actors in the framework of the UN-led efforts. That means that we will try to facilitate, in all possible ways, a Syrian-led process leading to a transition based on the Geneva communiqué of 2012. The point is that after three years and a half of war, the Syrian regime is still there. We need to find other ways to stick to the same principles of the Geneva communiqué, but trying to find the most effective ways of facing the conflict. The second level, apart from the diplomatic one, on which the European Union has decided to engage, is the humanitarian aid. This is urgent and we feel the sense of urgency. Again, having been at the border in Gaziantep last week, I met refugees and also humanitarian aid workers that are doing an excellent and very difficult job. Their work is done with the support of the European Union and of the Member States. The amount of funds of support that the European Union has allocated so far on the crisis in Syria is 3 billion euro both in Syria and in the neighbouring countries. And we know that we need to keep that effort going not only for Syrian refugees, not only for Syrian internally displaced persons, not only for the children - because we are losing generations of young Syrians who are not able to go to school, and this may become a major problem in 10 – 15 – 20 years from now; but we also have to do very much in the neighbouring countries -, Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon. In particular we have to work not only on the refugees, but also on the hosting communities. It is crucial that the hosting process of refugees doesn't turn into a major social and economic problem for countries that are already in themselves fragile not only from the economic social point of view but also from the security point of view. We know in particular for Lebanon this is going to be critical, and this requires our humanitarian help but also our political support. When I said that we decided to work on the humanitarian assistance for Syria, I also mean that if and when we manage to have a freeze of the hostilities in Aleppo, the European Union will have to be ready to come in with major humanitarian support, to make the life of the people in Aleppo dramatically better than it has been so far. We have also launched an EU Trust Fund for Syria. This is an instrument that makes it easier to use the funds, more flexible, and especially quicker - which is exactly what we need. In case we get to a positive step we have to be ready to get a lot of humanitarian aid immediately in the city. We have also discussed the regional strategy on our fight against Daesh. All the EU Member States are in one way or another - from a  military point of view, or  humanitarian point of view or narrative point of view, the culture point of view - involved in the fight against Daesh, and all of us are very much working on the support of the Iraqi government. I am going to be in Iraq Monday and Tuesday next week, visiting not only Baghdad but also Erbil, and different levels of institutions. I will convey the message of inclusiveness that can be implemented, as it is already on the way in Iraq. It could be a good way of moving ahead in a situation that only few months ago was desperate and now maybe allows us to have some hopes for the future. Another point in which the Council has adopted Conclusions is Bosnia and Herzegovina. I paid together with Commissioner Hahn a visit to Sarajevo some days ago, in the follow up of the Council of November when we were asked to visit Sarajevo. We met with the political institutional leaderships there, to check if there was a level of engagement of commitment sufficient enough for us to want to engage in a process that could move Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to the European Union. The visit was extremely positive, we met with the presidency, we met with 12 political leaders in Parliaments, we met with civil society and we came to the conclusion that ‘yes, there can be a new start for EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina’, and we have to take the most out of this possibility. So the Council today has decided that we will be ready to re-sequence the order in which the conditionality will be faced. We have agreed with the ministers, after having agreed with the Bosnian leadership, that in Sarajevo there will be a work starting tomorrow to draft and agree on a written declaration, a written commitment, from the side of the presidency, of the leadership of different parties and a vote of the Parliament in Bosnia and Herzegovina to clearly state the commitment and the engagement of the leadership and of the population that is more than ready to move towards a European Union, to reforms, starting from economic and social reforms, but then also tackling the functionality of the State and all the different levels of the authorities. We are ready to engage, we are ready to reciprocate in the moment when this commitment will be adopted by the Parliament, and we really believe - with a very, I have to say, positive mood and discussion we had with all the Ministers - that this could be a turning point in the way of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the European Union. All the Western Balkans are European countries and we need to make sure that together we move towards that direction consistently and not only in words. We had other points on the agenda with no conclusions adopted, but still extremely important. Let me mention two of them: one was Libya. We had a closed door discussion between ministers only and Bernardino León in a video conference from Tunis. He is, as we speak, working extremely hard on having a second phase of the Ghadames process, a political dialogue inside a country with different actors. I will not enter too much into the details now, it might be the case tomorrow or in the coming days, but let me just stress our full support to the political dialogue, full support to Bernardino's efforts and a strong call from all the 28 Member States to all parts in Tripoli, in Tobruk, everywhere in Libya to sit at the table and to start talks. It is clear that no one will ever be able to rule over Libya out of military means and that the political process needs to start. The EU is ready and we will discuss that further. On one side, to do all that we can to support the political dialogue once it starts, or to take measures in case it doesn't start. Today what is important to do is to put a very clear, a very open unambiguous pressure on all sides in Libya to make this national dialogue start and work, because there is no alternative for the country to survive if they do not come to the table and talk among themselves. Let me mention another two points before I leave you the floor for the questions. As you know, we are meeting again in a few hours with the Ukrainian Prime Minister as we will make today an important step: we have the first Association Council between the European Union and Ukraine. We didn't have Ukraine on the agenda today, but this does not mean that Ukraine is not on our working agenda every day, this is very much the case. And tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, as you know, I will be paying a visit to Kyiv. I will meet with President Poroshenko, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk again, many Members of the Cabinet, Parliament, the opposition, civil society. And then last point, but not least. The Council took note of the work that was done on Ebola. This was already discussed during the Development Foreign Affairs Council that took place last Friday in the logic of making full use of all the formats of the Council. So Ebola was mainly treated by the Development Council on Friday, we just had a short point today to take note of the written report that was done by EU Coordinator and Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs Stylianides, and that will also be adopted by the European Council on Thursday. Let me also say that in view of the European Council I met yesterday with President Tusk to prepare the summit and to make sure that the work of the Foreign Affairs Councils in different formats and the European Council is as much as possible coordinated and going in the same direction. That – I would say – is the case. I would say that the cooperation is excellent. Thank you very much! Bruxelles"

"Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the OSCE Ministerial Council in Basel, 4 December 2014",04.12.2014,04.12.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/565_en,,"While the crisis in and around Ukraine pushes the OSCE to its limits, it has also highlighted the OSCE's relevance and strengths as an organisation: First, the crisis has underlined the value of the OSCE concept of comprehensive security. Ukraine has shown that there can be no lasting security and stability without good governance and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We therefore remain extremely concerned by the trend that OSCE principles and commitments are increasingly challenged in parts of the OSCE area. Ukraine has reminded us why more than twenty years ago we agreed that commitments in the human dimension are matters of direct and legitimate concern to all participating States and do not belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State concerned. Second, events in and around Ukraine have demonstrated the value of OSCE field operations. We support the impartial work of the Special Monitoring Mission and commend its reporting activities and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. We also commend the way the Project Coordinator in Ukraine has responded to new developments. Third, the engagement of ODIHR, the High Commissioner on National Minorities, and the Representative on the Freedom of the Media testifies to the crucial role of the autonomous OSCE institutions that play an indispensable role in assisting participating States in implementing their commitments. Let me say on behalf of all the European Union how much we value the Swiss Chairmanship for its efforts with regard to the crisis in and around Ukraine, including through the Trilateral Contact Group, and the excellent, precious work that Heidi Tagliavini has done and is doing in this regard. We welcome the commitment of the incoming Serbian Chairmanship to maintain a strong focus and balanced approach to this crisis. We trust that the incoming Chairmanship will do its utmost to uphold the OSCE principles and commitments. We all need to work towards a sustainable political solution to the crisis in and around Ukraine. Any solution must be based on respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. As first steps, the Minsk Protocol and Memorandum, as the only commonly agreed framework, need to be fully implemented without further delay. It is clear that little can be achieved without Russia's genuine commitment and constructive engagement. Russia needs to assume and exercise its responsibilities. The inflow of weapons, equipment and troops from across the Russian border must be halted. Equally, we call for the withdrawal of any illegal and foreign forces, mercenaries and military equipment from eastern Ukraine. A lasting political solution requires also stepping up the political and economic reforms in Ukraine. I am confident that the new Parliament and the new Government in Ukraine will resume the reform process at full speed. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts and calls for the resumption of a genuine national dialogue. This year’s OSCE Ministerial, the Chairman reminded us, is very different from previous ones. Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol and destabilising actions in eastern Ukraine have seriously violated the basic OSCE principles and commitments, as enshrined notably in the Helsinki Final Act and Paris Charter. This is the larger issue we have to address today and tomorrow. We do not need to renegotiate these principles and commitments or develop new ones to address the current crisis. The existing principles have provided a solid cornerstone for European security for many years and they continue to be valid. They are, in fact, not negotiable, including the principle that borders are inviolable. The erosion of trust we are witnessing today can only be overcome by restoring respect for the basic principles of the OSCE and by genuine, open dialogue. I hope everyone will be ready to seize the opportunity of this Ministerial to start a process in this direction. The crisis in and around Ukraine is not the only conflict on our agenda. It is also important to achieve tangible progress in the resolution of the protracted conflicts in Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Time is not on the side of peace, and we know that very well. Next year we will see the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act in 1975. The Helsinki+40 process remains an opportunity to address the crisis of European security and to seek common ground on the way forward. But there will be little cause for celebration next year if the basic principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the very document we will be commemorating, continue to be seriously violated. We hope that the Panel of Eminent Persons can contribute to re-launching a genuine dialogue. Our discussions, Mr Chairman, here, under your chairmanship for which I want to thank you once again, provide an excellent opportunity to begin a process towards renewed respect for the basic principles underpinning security in Europe. The OSCE is, by definition, the forum for dialogue on European security and we should never underestimate its importance. I am confident that we all fully understand the relevance of our individual and collective responsibilities. Thank you very much. Bruxelles"

"Joint Statement by Catherine Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif following the talks in Vienna, 24 November 2014",24.11.2014,24.11.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/537_en,,"Since we agreed to the Joint Plan of Action one year ago in Geneva, we, together with the Foreign Ministers and Political Directors of the E3+3 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States), have been engaged in intensive diplomatic negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive solution. We once again express our appreciation to the Austrian Government for their most generous support in hosting these negotiations in Vienna. Based on the strong commitment by all sides to reach a mutually-agreed long-term comprehensive solution, we have held ten rounds of negotiations and numerous meetings during the past months. Some ideas have been developed, but given the technical nature of this effort and the decisions needed, more work is required to assess and finalize them as appropriate. We would have preferred to finalize a comprehensive solution here in Vienna. But we remain convinced that, based on the progress made and on the new ideas which continue to be explored, there is a credible path through which a comprehensive solution can be reached. We, together with the Foreign Ministers of the E3+3, have therefore agreed to continue our diplomatic efforts. We have decided to extend the measures of the Joint Plan of Action to allow for further negotiations until June 30th. We intend to build on the current momentum in order to complete these negotiations within the shortest possible time, up to four months, and if necessary to use the remaining time until the end of June to finalize any possible remaining technical and drafting work. Iran and the E3/EU+3 reaffirm that they will continue to implement all their commitments described in the Joint Plan of Action in an efficient and timely manner. The IAEA will be asked to continue monitoring the voluntary measures under the Joint Plan of Action. The next meeting to continue our work will happen in December. Bruxelles"
Remarks by High Representative Federica Mogherini after today's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council,17.11.2014,17.11.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/393_en,,"Thank you very much, I apologise for being late. That was not out of major divisions or discussions but out of real in-depth conversation on all the points that we had on the agenda, with all the ministers concentrating on the two main political issues that we decided to have on the agenda today: which is on one side Ukraine, and on the other side the Middle East Peace Process. But we also touched upon other issues to which I will come afterwards. First of all, we started the morning with an informal session on working methods and we have started working on some changes that we will introduce already from next time, a little bit more of informal exchanges, in a more open format with the ministers and with guests - in general Foreign Affairs Council more concentrated on political messages and decisions to orientate our common action, so concentrating more on what we can do rather than on analysing only the issues of the conflicts, and not only concentrating on conflict areas but also on mid-term and long-term strategies for the European Union's work. Coming to Ukraine, I guess you have seen already the conclusions we have adopted. The agreement among us is to define our action along three lines. On one side, obviously a major European Union role, as this is clearly a European crisis, concentrating on avoiding that the situation gets even worse from a military point of view, from a socio-economic point of view and from a humanitarian point of view in the East. We will develop our work, especially together with the OSCE, on the security level, but also with other regional organisations like the Council of Europe when it comes to internal reforms, for instance of the Constitution with the Venice Commission. But the main discussion today was how to re-launch or how to re-engage in a dialogue - given that Russia is for sure part of the problem but it is also for sure part of the solution, of the possible solution to the crisis. How to engage with Russia in a dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow, between Kyiv and the East of Ukraine, between the European Union and Russia, not only on Ukraine but also on a wide series of elements, global and regional issues, and this is going to be one of the issues on which we will go more in depth in the coming months, to reassess our overall relation with Russia. So, in one line: a major EU political role on the way to find effective means to have a political solution to the crisis, engaging in dialogue with Russia. Second, the instrument that we have used so far in our policy - not a policy in itself but an instrument - the economic pressure with sanctions that are an effective tool in a broader strategy: and in this view we decided today to have additional listings of individuals, as you have seen, and that will take place with a decision in the next two weeks. And the third element of the discussion of the action we are going to take is concerning the internal Ukrainian reform path. On one side, asking for the political forces to come with a government, with a coalition government, as soon as possible. We are planning a series of visits, both some of the Ministers and one Commissioner, actually a Vice-President of the Commission was already there last week, another Commissioner is going to visit soon - Commissioner Hahn - and I will pay a visit to Kyiv as soon as the new government is formed. And I discussed that with Foreign Minister Klimkin in a bilateral meeting we had this morning before starting the Foreign Affairs Council, and we also had the chance of signing - and actually it was my first act of signing in my new capacity - the Status of Mission Agreement for the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform that will start officially from December 1, as a clear sign of EU engagement to assist on the reforms. But apart from forming a government soon, we also made clear that we will ask the new government to commit to reforms internally, as this is crucial to guarantee that European Union support and assistance is there, and we strongly believe that this combination of three elements: attempt to have a political engagement; economic pressure with sanctions; and support, asking for commitment on the Ukrainian side on internal reforms could, hopefully, lead the way to some positive developments that at the moment are not definitely there. We then had an in-depth discussion on the Middle East, with some orientation for the future work as well. I reported from my visit in Gaza, West Bank, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Jordan, and of my contacts in the last days, most of all with John Kerry and with the actors in the region. And we decided that we definitely cannot just wait and see. The running of time is an element of desperation in the area that could be extremely dangerous, also for security reasons for Europe. We decided to support new initiatives to re-launch a peace process - the lack of peace process at the moment is one of the causes of violence coming back - and to coordinate on the UN Security Council process on the Middle East and in particular on the initiative to re-launch the process. We will build on the possibility of having a regional framework, so working not only with the US and not only obviously with the other among all us Europeans and in the UN Security Council but also with some of the key Arab countries that in the region can facilitate the restarting of the process, in particular Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia that initiated in 2002 the Arab Peace Initiative that could be somehow a basis for rethinking of the regional framework. We then pass to Ebola: we had a briefing from Commissioner Christos Stylianides who just came back yesterday from the countries most affected. He reported on his work in coordinating the efforts of the European Union to face the epidemic and we will come back on that more consistently in December at the Development Foreign Affairs Council and the Foreign Affairs Council also preparing the European Council of December that will take an assessment of the work done so far. Because among the working methods that we need to change is also better coordination between the different levels and formats of the Council, make sure that the previous ones manage to step in forming the Agenda and the decisions of the European Council itself. We had then a long and good discussion on the Balkans and on Bosnia-Herzegovina starting from the initiative that some of the Member States were proposing and suggesting in the last months - the last of which was a German/UK initiative but Croatia, Slovenia were suggesting similar things in the last months - trying to take advantage of the fact that just today the State Presidency was inaugurated, we have a new Commission here, so without touching any of the basic principles of our negotiations still we believe that there might be a chance of opening a process on new basis, without touching the conditionality obviously and without lowering the bar in any case. There was in this sense an agreement by the Member States that we should proceed in the coming days on that direction to Sarajevo. We had also point on Libya, sharing the need for continuous support even in extremely difficult conditions to the work that the UN Secretary General Special Envoy Bernardino León is trying still to work on, to facilitate an internal dialogue so that we could get to one government ruling one country. So no military option and no division of Libya. Thank you very much, I was not only late but also long. I am ready to answer to your questions.  Questions and answers  1- Question sur l’hypothèse d’un plan de sanctions contre Israël. Il n'y a pas de plan de ce type. J'ai vu un article d'Haaretz qui fait référence à un document de travail  et le publie. Il s'agit apparemment d'un document de travail interne demandé par les États membres il y a quelques temps, je dirais durant le mandat qui a précédé le mien, mais qui ne forme qu'une hypothèse de travail technique. Ce n'était pas sur la table des ministres aujourd'hui. Ce n'était pas du tout au cœur de notre discussion. Le cœur de notre discussion d'aujourd'hui sur le Moyen Orient était plutôt de voir comment engager un processus positif avec les Israéliens et les Palestiniens pour relancer un processus de paix, et non d'isoler ou sanctionner quoique ce soit, mais, au contraire, de remotiver vers le chemin du dialogue et de la paix. 2- Sur le dialogue avec la Russie et une éventuelle visite à Moscou. Le point a été soulevé pendant la discussion aujourd'hui. Plusieurs ministres m'ont demandé de le faire. Je le prends comme un signal positif de la volonté  d'ouvrir un dialogue, qui par ailleurs n'a jamais été fermé. Je me souviens, quand j'étais dans une autre capacité, d'avoir participé à Milan à un rencontre à laquelle a participé non seulement des chefs d'État et de gouvernement mais aussi le président de la Commission européenne et le président du Conseil européen.  Le lien, l'ouverture au dialogue entre la Fédération Russe et l'UE était déjà ouvert. Je pense que cela sera utile. D'autre part, à Brisbane, le Président Juncker a rencontré le Président Putin. Maintenant, au-delà du fait de se parler, il s'agit surtout de savoir bien de quoi nous nous parlons. Il conviendra de préparer sérieusement l'agenda d'une visite  et y aller s'il y a des conditions réelles pour une discussion politique qui peut mener vers des pas positifs sur l'Ukraine et aussi peut-être des pas positifs sur d'autres dossiers que l'on partage et qui sont des préoccupations majeures pour la région. 3- On the December European Council discussing further economic sanctions against Russia. If you allow me, we are here to comment on the FAC that has just concluded with conclusions. And that's fine; that is very good for me to brief you on that and to receive your questions. On the other side, commenting on eventual conclusions of the European Council that is about to come in more than one month would be a little bit beyond my capacities and my possibilities. I do not expect that today we can think of something like that. 4- On MEPP and full implementation of existing legislation of settlement products. On the Middle East Peace Process, it means that we will continue to implement the policies that were agreed on, but as I explained, the core of our worries and of our efforts is and will be not to react to negative steps, but to engage in positive processes and the worrying situation is, that the less we have political positive processes, the more we risk to have negative steps on the ground, so we have to break this vicious circle with some positive elements that at the moment are desperately lacking. 5- Sur la Reconnaissance d'un Etat Palestinien. Nous avons commencé à discuter de cela même si cela relève bien sûr de la compétence des Etats Membres; sur ce point, la responsabilité n'est pas la mienne. Mais nous avons partagé la nécessité d'au moins échanger, entre nous, entre les ministres, les informations sur les démarches de parlements nationaux, les éléments de réactions des gouvernements à ce sujet et commencer à donner, non pas des réponses communes mais de partager les grandes lignes d'action sur ce sujet. 6- Sur les missions EUBAM Rafah/EUPOL COPPS. J'ai  visité les missions quand j'étais dans la région il y a une semaine. Il ne s'agit pas d'une question de temps, je ne dirais même pas de une question de ressources, parce que je pense que sur ce domaine, les Etats-Membres  seraient prêts à donner les ressources humaines et financières qu'il faut. Le problème principal, ce sont les conditions politiques sur le terrain. Il faut que les points de passage soient contrôlés avec la coopération des autorités palestiniennes. Si nous n'avons pas l'Autorité Palestinienne sur place capable de contrôler les points de passage, ce sera difficile pour une mission européenne de travailler sur le terrain. Dans mes conversations, que ce soit en Israël ou avec les Palestiniens, c'est  le point le plus délicat: à savoir, les conditions politiques, et ce même avant la sécurité, sur place, pour que cela puisse se passer avec un interlocuteur légitime, crédible et efficace sur le terrain à Gaza. 7- On Ukraine and new impetus for a dialogue with Russia. That's why I said that before deciding if it's useful to go to Russia for me, first of all, I would need to prepare, definitely, no, but apart from that, we need to, in case, check if the conditions are there for the meeting to be fruitful and to prepare that kind of meeting, but the decision has not been taken yet. It was an element for discussion that was raised by some Ministers, quite many Ministers, and that I accepted as a possibility to explore, in particular after a further discussion among the Member States in the next, probably, meeting or few meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council on the overall strategic relation between the EU and Russia, not only on Ukraine but also on several other issues. 8- On the recognition of the Palestinian state, I stated already several times, including in Israel and in Palestine, that to me the real point is not so much the recognition of a Palestinian state, but what can we usefully do to have a Palestinian state, because you can have the recognition in several Member States without things changing radically and dramatically on the ground. Or, on the contrary, you could have a wave of pressure that could lead to some positive results, or not, depending on the kind of process that is open or not. So again, I think that our main focus should be, and as a European focus for sure, because this does not lie in the European Union capacity to recognise a State so, it's for the Member States to take the decisions, but to me the main focus is what kind of steps forward do we can put in place forgetting to having a Palestinian state living next to an Israeli State in peace and security. What is the road map of political actions that we manage to put in place for reaching the objective? The objective is not the recognition of the Palestinian State. The objective is the Palestinian state. And we should not mix the two levels but this is a discussion that for sure will be ongoing also in the format of the ministerial meeting because as I said it's a matter of national decisions but we decided that also that as it is a matter that concerns us all, we will try to share a vision and coordinate a bit already from now.

Remarks by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini ahead of the Foreign Affairs Council,17.11.2014,17.11.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6794_en,,"Good morning! We have a new start this morning. Not only for Europe, as the Commission's slogan says, but also for Foreign Policy. We will start with the Ministers early this morning with a discussion on the working methods. If we want to be effective in the world, we need to be effective starting from here, from Brussels. So, we will try to share our common vision and make it owned by all the 28 Member States. Obviously, we will discuss Ukraine which is the main issue on the agenda today. We will for sure discuss the sanctions, but not only the sanctions - because we all know very well that if we work only on that, but not on the other two tracks, even sanctions will not work. We need to work more on the reforms of Ukraine. We will start right know by meeting Foreign Minister Klimkin and we will sign an agreement that allows the European Union to start a mission to assist the Ukrainian authorities on restructuring the civilian security of the country. We will start the mission as of 1 December 2014. We will also discuss about the relations and the dialogue with Russia to get to a solution of the crisis. *** We will discuss about what is the best option today for reacting to the so-called elections of the 2nd November that we said are illegal and illegitimate and might require some reaction from the European Union side. We will have an open discussion about that, but as I said, sanctions in themselves are not a target, are not an objective, they can be an instrument if they come together with other measures. And I think it is time that the European Union and the Ministers concentrate also on the other issues that we have to build to have a complete strategy. And that means on one side asking the Ukrainians to commit again to reforms and to find ways to better to assist them on reforms, because the best way of getting ahead is making Ukraine a success and this has to be our focus mainly and also how to re-launch or how to engage in a dialogue with Russia as the European Union. These are going to be the three tracks of our discussions today with the Ministers. *** Then, the other big point on the agenda is the Middle East. I will report on my visit there. We will discuss what kind of European Union role can be there in order to re-launch the talks to get to the two States living in peace and security one next to the other. We will share our visions on that with the ministers in view of a European Union role. *** I was personally in contact during the last days with Secretary Kerry, with President Abbas, with the Israeli side, with the Jordanians, to see what kind of diplomatic and political initiative can be there. Because we all know very well that what we need is not just a recognition, we need the building of a Palestinian state that can live next to Israeli one in peace and security. So our effort will be today, to understand in which way the European Union that has so much in terms of peace, history and knowledge internally, can do to re-put on track the political perspective that at the moment seems not to be there, but we need to have a political perspective for Palestine and also for Israel and for its security. *** Amongst the other points on the agenda, although I will try to make them short and leave it for a main discussion in the coming meetings, will be Ebola. We will have a report from Commissioner Stylianides who has just come back from the affected African countries. *** We will also have a discussion on the Western Balkans, in particular on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and surely on Libya. On BiH we will look with the ministers at the different proposals that many of them raised, about asking a recommitment to the reform process, especially to the Compact for Growth. I find it particularly symbolic that we have that discussion today early afternoon, exactly at the same time when the new State Presidency is due to be sworn in. I think we will engage in that kind of process if the Member States agree, trying to bring Bosnia closer to the European path. *** All in all, we will try to have a more focused ministerial meeting today with a more political-oriented discussion, especially trying to get to some decisions for action together. I hope that we will come out of this meeting around 16:00 or 16:30 and meet you again, not only me, but also some of the ministers, with a clear and united message that will help us orientate our common action. Indeed, we need to reflect and share views but most of all we need to change the working method in the way that we can get out of here with a clear track of what we do together in the same direction.

Remarks by High Representative Federica Mogherini after today's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council,17.11.2014,17.11.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6739_en,,"Thank you very much, I apologise for being late. That was not out of major divisions or discussions but out of real in-depth conversation on all the points that we had on the agenda, with all the ministers concentrating on the two main political issues that we decided to have on the agenda today: which is on one side Ukraine, and on the other side the Middle East Peace Process. But we also touched upon other issues to which I will come afterwards. First of all, we started the morning with an informal session on working methods and we have started working on some changes that we will introduce already from next time, a little bit more of informal exchanges, in a more open format with the ministers and with guests - in general Foreign Affairs Council more concentrated on political messages and decisions to orientate our common action, so concentrating more on what we can do rather than on analysing only the issues of the conflicts, and not only concentrating on conflict areas but also on mid-term and long-term strategies for the European Union's work. Coming to Ukraine, I guess you have seen already the conclusions we have adopted. The agreement among us is to define our action along three lines. On one side, obviously a major European Union role, as this is clearly a European crisis, concentrating on avoiding that the situation gets even worse from a military point of view, from a socio-economic point of view and from a humanitarian point of view in the East. We will develop our work, especially together with the OSCE, on the security level, but also with other regional organisations like the Council of Europe when it comes to internal reforms, for instance of the Constitution with the Venice Commission. But the main discussion today was how to re-launch or how to re-engage in a dialogue - given that Russia is for sure part of the problem but it is also for sure part of the solution, of the possible solution to the crisis. How to engage with Russia in a dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow, between Kyiv and the East of Ukraine, between the European Union and Russia, not only on Ukraine but also on a wide series of elements, global and regional issues, and this is going to be one of the issues on which we will go more in depth in the coming months, to reassess our overall relation with Russia. So, in one line: a major EU political role on the way to find effective means to have a political solution to the crisis, engaging in dialogue with Russia. Second, the instrument that we have used so far in our policy - not a policy in itself but an instrument - the economic pressure with sanctions that are an effective tool in a broader strategy: and in this view we decided today to have additional listings of individuals, as you have seen, and that will take place with a decision in the next two weeks. And the third element of the discussion of the action we are going to take is concerning the internal Ukrainian reform path. On one side, asking for the political forces to come with a government, with a coalition government, as soon as possible. We are planning a series of visits, both some of the Ministers and one Commissioner, actually a Vice-President of the Commission was already there last week, another Commissioner is going to visit soon - Commissioner Hahn - and I will pay a visit to Kyiv as soon as the new government is formed. And I discussed that with Foreign Minister Klimkin in a bilateral meeting we had this morning before starting the Foreign Affairs Council, and we also had the chance of signing - and actually it was my first act of signing in my new capacity - the Status of Mission Agreement for the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform that will start officially from December 1, as a clear sign of EU engagement to assist on the reforms. But apart from forming a government soon, we also made clear that we will ask the new government to commit to reforms internally, as this is crucial to guarantee that European Union support and assistance is there, and we strongly believe that this combination of three elements: attempt to have a political engagement; economic pressure with sanctions; and support, asking for commitment on the Ukrainian side on internal reforms could, hopefully, lead the way to some positive developments that at the moment are not definitely there. We then had an in-depth discussion on the Middle East, with some orientation for the future work as well. I reported from my visit in Gaza, West Bank, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Jordan, and of my contacts in the last days, most of all with John Kerry and with the actors in the region. And we decided that we definitely cannot just wait and see. The running of time is an element of desperation in the area that could be extremely dangerous, also for security reasons for Europe. We decided to support new initiatives to re-launch a peace process - the lack of peace process at the moment is one of the causes of violence coming back - and to coordinate on the UN Security Council process on the Middle East and in particular on the initiative to re-launch the process. We will build on the possibility of having a regional framework, so working not only with the US and not only obviously with the other among all us Europeans and in the UN Security Council but also with some of the key Arab countries that in the region can facilitate the restarting of the process, in particular Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia that initiated in 2002 the Arab Peace Initiative that could be somehow a basis for rethinking of the regional framework. We then pass to Ebola: we had a briefing from Commissioner Christos Stylianides who just came back yesterday from the countries most affected.

We will have a report from Commissioner Stylianides who has just come back from the affected African countries. *** We will also have a discussion on the Western Balkans, in particular on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and surely on Libya. On BiH we will look with the ministers at the different proposals that many of them raised, about asking a recommitment to the reform process, especially to the Compact for Growth. I find it particularly symbolic that we have that discussion today early afternoon, exactly at the same time when the new State Presidency is due to be sworn in. I think we will engage in that kind of process if the Member States agree, trying to bring Bosnia closer to the European path. *** All in all, we will try to have a more focused ministerial meeting today with a more political-oriented discussion, especially trying to get to some decisions for action together. I hope that we will come out of this meeting around 16:00 or 16:30 and meet you again, not only me, but also some of the ministers, with a clear and united message that will help us orientate our common action. Indeed, we need to reflect and share views but most of all we need to change the working method in the way that we can get out of here with a clear track of what we do together in the same direction.

HR/VP meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,05.11.2014,05.11.2014,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/6839_en,,"Remarks by High Representative Federica Mogherini following her meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Thank you very much! This is actually, I am just realising, my first conference in this capacity, and I am very happy that it is with Jens, with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. This is my second working day in office, even if Sunday was already a working day as you can imagine. We discussed before he became Secretary General and before I became High Representative that we would work together closely and that we would coordinate as much as we can, and also that we would meet very soon at the beginning of our respective mandates. He had to wait some weeks for me to join. But here we are and I am happy that this is not only the first conference that I do here but also my first bilateral meeting that I have in my capacity. It is therefore a great pleasure also personally since we know each for a long time, and I think that also personally we can go very well together which is going to be very important for our respective constituencies. We have obviously different mandates and different memberships, even if 22 of our Member States are the same, but we have a common challenge in front of us: a security environment that is all the more worrying every day. Furthermore, the intention stated both by the European Union (EU) at the Council in June and by NATO at the last summit in Wales, is that cooperation among us should improve.  This is the only way of having effective capabilities on the military ground. We all know how much it is important that we manage to have an effective work on the defence and security landscape. We decided that we would meet regularly, hoping to be in Brussels quite often. We decided also that we would participate respectively in meetings taking place in our organisations. I had the pleasure of inviting Secretary General Stoltenberg to the next Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) meeting in the format of Defence taking place on 18 November. We also discussed my presence at the next NATO Ministerial at the beginning of December. We would thus be happy to work together on defining further the cooperation between NATO and the EU in the coming months. Our mandates start together, and we have some years in the course of which we can develop this cooperation in an effective way. We covered also in our meeting all the hot topics that we have on our agenda, starting with Ukraine and Russia. We shared the need for a firm and strong reaction, together with an open channel of dialogue. This mix could maybe give us some hope for a political solution of the crisis in the East of Ukraine, for the sake of us all and also, and first of all, for the Ukrainian interest. We also discussed issues related to the Middle East and the Mediterranean, in particular Syria, Iraq and Libya. We also discussed the situation in the Western Balkans where both NATO and the EU have an engagement and a presence. Even if it is not related strictly related to EU-NATO cooperation, let me say a few words on EULEX Kosovo. I know that it is high on your agenda and it is also high on my agenda. I started dealing with the case yesterday that was my first day in office. As you know, yesterday, there was a discussion on the matter in the AFET Committee of the European Parliament. I intend to appoint, as a matter of urgency, an independent and experienced legal expert to review the mission's mandate and implementation with a particular focus on the handling of the allegations of corruption. The name will be communicated as soon as it is agreed on. Bruxelles"
